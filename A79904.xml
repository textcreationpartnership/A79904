            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now above twenty years since I was chosen Lecturer in <hi>Warwick,</hi> at which time meeting with some opposition, your Lordship was pleased so far to own me, as
<pb facs="tcp:117874:4"/> to make me your Chaplain, and to write your Letter in my behalf, whereby you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the heat of my adversary, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured my peace; since which time I have wanted opportunity to testifie to the world my gratitude for so noble a favour, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now about to publish the lives of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> who were eminent for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Bulwarks to the Church, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to godly Ministers, against the rage of Satan, and his instruments; I could find no fitter person to dedicate it unto, then your Lordship, who hath always been a Pattern of Piety, and a Patron to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it: I am sure the whole Kingdom can testifie your godly care to present able Ministers to those places which God hath made you the disposer of: Your exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequenting of Lectures, hath been a great encouragement both to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and people: Your house hath been always open for the entertainment of Gods Ambassadors, even in the worst of times; and you are not yet ashamed to own them, <note place="margin">1 Cor 4. 13.</note> when they <hi>are accounted as the filth of the</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:117874:4"/>
                     <hi>world, and the off-scouring of all things,</hi> and the greatest <hi>troublers</hi> of the Land: when <hi>they are for signs and wonders, and that in Israel:</hi> I need <note place="margin">Isa. 8. 18.</note> not mention your faithfulness, your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, your zeal for the good both of the King and Kingdom, in the middest of our late confusions: they are sufficiently known to all, and I presume that some which are now your adversaries will acknowledge, that your interest both at Sea and Land was a great means to preserve us from being swallowed up by the common adversary: and though your Lordship be now laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side like a <hi>broken Vessel,</hi> in these daies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God hath <hi>stained the pride of all glory, and brought into contempt all the honorable of the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 23. 9.</note>
                     <hi>Land;</hi> Yet I doubt not but God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>your labor of love,</hi> and all the good which you have done for his house, and that it shall add <hi>to your account</hi> in the great day of the Lord. <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Go on therefore (Right Honorable) still to enoble your Name, and Family, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out your self for <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> a godly
<pb facs="tcp:117874:5"/> fruitfull life, having a fairer prospect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards honor, then all the advantages in the world besides. There is (saith one) a <note place="margin">Pihl. 4. 17.</note> Divine and supernaturall Nobility, where God is the top of the kin, and Religion is the Root, in regard of which all other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is but a shadow.</p>
                  <p>To be entituled unto this, I presume is your Lordships care, and to have your name found in the Book of Life, is the heighth of your ambition; and to be able to read it there, will be the foundation of all your comfort: Hereby your Lordship shall have sweet peace in the most trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some times; for whilest the frame of the the Spirit in the ambitious, voluptuous, and riotous person, is like the lower part of the Elementary Region, full of unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness, because the seat of Winds, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, and earthquakes: The believers soul, on the contrary, is like that part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, which is always peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ever enjoys true rest, and joy.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:117874:5"/>
                  <p> Many examples hereof your Lordship may find collected together in this Book, which I hope will not prove useless, nor fruitless in the reading: Examples are of a very attractive nature, and whilest we read and consider what Gods Worthies have formerly by Gods grace been enabled to do, and suffer for him, and his cause, we may have our faith and hope strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by relying upon him for the like as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in all the various changes which do befall us in this our Earthly Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: For, as though an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then be laid upon a whole shoulder, yet it goes away with it well enough: So if the Soul and Spirit be sound, and God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables a man to bear it, diseases, disgraces, imprisonment, banishment, &amp;c. are easily born.</p>
                  <p>The Lord in mercy preserve, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract your Lordships life, still to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to the afflicted, an honor to your Country, a Patron to the Faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>Iesus Christ:</hi> and so fill you with all grace, and goodness here, that

To whom I answer no more then this, that severe censures of other mens faults, are like Crows that fasten onely upon Carrion; or like the Horse-flie, that coming into a field of sweet flowers, yet if there be any dung, his eye, and scent is onely to that, and upon that onely will he light: whereas God on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary (and so should his children) spieth out, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth gold, though but a dram, from a mass of dross; and good grain, though but an handful, from an heap of chaff.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117874:13"/> He was a man of singular clemency towards men, and piety towards God, not stayning his reigne with the <note place="margin">A good Prince.</note> blood of the Saints, as his predecessors had done; he little regarded his private profit, but sought the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of his subjects rather, saying, <hi>that it was more behoofefull for the Common-wealth, that the wealth of the Land should be dispersed in the hands of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, then locked up in the Princes coffers:</hi> he was so averse from all superfluities, that upon Festival dayes, <note place="margin">Humility.</note> and when he entertained strangers, he was faigne to borrow plate of his friends to furnish his Cupbords: this comming to <hi>Dioclesians</hi> eare, he sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to him, reproaching him with poverty, because his treasury was empty: But <hi>Constantius</hi> intreating them to stay awhile, summoned a Parliament of his wealthiest Subjects, to whom he declared his need of money, telling them that now was the time for them to expresse their love to their Lord and King; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon without delay, they strove to fill his Exchequer with gold and silver, which being done, <hi>Constantius</hi> shewed it to the Ambassadors, bidding them tell their Master, that this treasure which he had now collected, was before in the hands of his Subjects, who as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny treasurers kept it for his use: The Ambassadours wondred at it; but after their departure, the good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour restored it againe to the former owners, with many expressions of his royall favour towards them. Also to try his Courtiers, he cōmanded all to sacrifice to Idolls, pretending to discard all that refused so to do; but contrarywise those that obeyed, he put from the Court, saying, <hi>that they which are disloyall to God,</hi>

                        <hi>will never be true and trusty to their Prince.</hi> His first

                        <hi>leaue my unaccomplished actions to be performed by thee my son, &amp;c.

                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117874:14"/> and so taking his last farewell of his son, and friends, he ended his daies <hi>Anno Christi</hi> Three hundred and six, &amp; of his age fiftie six: having been <hi>Caesar</hi> sixteen yeares, and <hi>Augustus</hi> two yeares: Immediately <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> by acclamation of the people, assistance of the souldiers, and advice of <hi>Erocus</hi> King of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines</hi> (who by the way had accompanied him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his flight from <hi>Rome)</hi> was proclaimed Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and successor to that part of the world which his Father held: which election was joyfully rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by the Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> and gladly accepted by all other provinces, who accounted this Iland of all other most happy, which first saw him <hi>Caesar:</hi> His first worke was to prosecute the warre begun by his father against the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> whom he subdued, together with the Inhabitants of the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Ilands: But the unruly Pretorian Souldiers at <hi>Rome,</hi> hearing of the death of <hi>Constantius,</hi> proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Maxentius,</hi> the son of <hi>Maximianus Herculius,</hi> Emperour, who by his Necromancies, Adulteries, persecutions, and murthers, grew so odious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to all, that the Senate sent to <hi>Constantine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A wicked Tyrant.</note> craving his aide to redresse these things: But in the meane time <hi>Maxentius</hi> was growne to that height of impiety, and impurity, that he violently tooke away mens wiues from them, and having violated their chastity, sent them back to their husbands againe: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, a Christian matrone, wife to a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, understanding that the Tyrants messengers were <note place="margin">Chastity.</note> at the doore to fetch her to him, she desired some time to dresse her selfe, and so going into her chamber, she ran a sword into her side, and fell downe dead,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117874:14"/> leaving her body to the buriall, rather then to satisfie the Tyrants lust: He also massacred, and put his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to death upon every light occasion: many of the Senators he slew for their wealth: He gave himselfe over to Magicall arts, ripping open the wombs of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men great with child, searching the bowells of tender Infants, &amp; other creatures; he by conjurations raised Devills, to consult with them about the issue of his wars. <hi>Maximianus</hi> his father pretending a dislike of these outragious courses of his son, repaired to his son in Law <hi>Constantine,</hi> who had maried his daughter <hi>Fausta,</hi> to complaine to him of them: but whilst he was with him, he secretly tampered with his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make away her husband; but the good Lady, knowing that her bond to her husband was greater <note place="margin">A good Wife.</note> then that to her father, she revealed it to <hi>Constantine,</hi> who thereupon caused him to be put to death: and then commiserating the Lamentable condition of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he raised an Army, and marched towards <hi>Rome</hi> against that Tyrant <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and drawing <hi>Licinius</hi> governour of <hi>Sclavonia</hi> (who was made <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar)</hi> to his side, by giving him his sister <hi>Constantia</hi> to wife, he hasted towards <hi>Rome</hi> with an Army of 90000 foot, and eight thousand horse, levied out of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> but knowing well that successe in warr dependeth more on Divine assistance then humane strength: he considered unto what God he should addresse his prayers for successe, (for as yet he was not fully setled in the Christian faith) &amp; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that his predecessors, who had worshipped ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods, &amp; put their trust in them, had so often mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried, and that on the contrary, his Father, that had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117874:15"/> only worshipped one, and the true God, had a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py raigne, and was still preserved from many dangers, he therefore resolved to worship, and adore that God only, which his father had served: wherefore he earnestly prayed unto God, to reveale himselfe to him, and to prosper him in his journey, <note place="margin">Prayer powerfull.</note> and whilst he was thus praying, lifting up his eyes to heaven about noone day, he beheld the signe of a Crosse lively figured in the aire, with this inscription, <hi>In hoc vince,</hi> By this overcome; himselfe and all his Army wondring at so strange a prodigie, and being much troubled in his minde to know the meaning of it, the night following Christ appeared to him in his sleep, commanding him to make the like Figure, and Banner against his enemies: whereupon the next day, imparting the vision to his friends, he sent for the best goldsmiths, and Lapidaries, to make the like Crosse with gold and pretious stones, and withall re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solving to worship that God only, who had thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, he sent for godly ministers to instruct him therein, who shewed him that Christ was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten son of God, of his coming into the world, his holy life, death, &amp;c. Afterwards with great cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he went forwards bearing before him, and his victorious Army, instead of the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Eagle, the forme of this vision imbroydered upon his stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard: <hi>Maxentius,</hi> as much depending upon his force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, was no lesse confident of victory, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof he framed a deceitfull bridg over <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to intrap <hi>Constantine:</hi> and also sent out diverse Armyes to oppose him, before he should come neere the City; But <hi>Constantine</hi> trusting only in God, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117874:15"/> at the first incounter, his first, second, and third <note place="margin">Faith.</note> Armies, and so marching thorow all <hi>Italy,</hi> he brought his victorious ensignes neere the walls of <hi>Rome.</hi> Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Maxentius</hi> led forth his Army above a mile from <hi>Rome,</hi> and joyned battaile with <hi>Constantine,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcharged by the vantgard of <hi>Constantine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed caught in his own snare.</note> he with the rest of his army fled, and either through hast, or forgetfullnesse, tooke over the deceitfull bridg, which he had made to entrap <hi>Constantine,</hi> but no sooner were they entred upon it, but it fell in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherby they were all drowned; <hi>Constantine</hi> &amp; his Army remaining victorious, sang praises unto God for the same. The Senators, nobles, and all the people <note place="margin">Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> being freed from servitude, received him with rejoycing hearts, and loud acclamations; men, women, children and servants called him their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone, and preserver. But his humble minde was not <note place="margin">Humility.</note> puffed up with their praises, and applause, but ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all to God, he gaue thankes to him as the giver of victory: He erected for a Trophy his owne Image, holding a Banner with a crosse quartered in it. All the Westerne Nations also having obtained liberty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, kept festivalls in honor of <hi>Constantine.</hi> He publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>royall</hi> edicts, whereby he restored to his subiects <note place="margin">Justice.</note> all those lands which had beene iniuriously taken from them; calling some from banishment, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others from Captivity, whom the Tyrants had imprisoned: he gat godly ministers about him, and <note place="margin">Ministers honoured, and loved.</note> although they went in poore and meane habits, not considering their outside, but honoring the Image of God in them, he set them at his owne table, tooke them with him whither soever he went, that he might
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117874:16"/> enjoy the benefit of their prayers. He repaired some <note place="margin">Charity.</note> Churches, Built others, and releeved many poore men with bountifull donations and gifts: To those that begged in the streets, and at his gate, he gave monie, meate, and clothing: and to such as by wrongs, and oppressions were falne into want, he gave pensions: He was a father to the fatherlesse, an hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to the widdowes: he married young maides, that were Orphans, to honest wealthy men, and gave them portions, &amp; was very gratious to all petitioners &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed Sutors: And perceiving that there was much stiscord, <note place="margin">Vnity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored.</note> &amp; various opinions in matters of religion, he called a Synod of the Clergie, where he was present himself: dismissing his guard, as superfluous, whilst he was environed with godly &amp; learned men: he declared to them the controverted points, whereof they were to consult, being very desirous to settle the Church in peace and unity; those which were of a quiet and peaceable temper, he made much of, and much disliked those which were otherwise: And God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite his care of his house, made all the barbarous <note place="margin">Gods goodnesse.</note> nations to prostrate themselves at his feet: He made him a conqueror, and terrible to his enemies, who of his owne nature was of a most gentle and gratious disposition: Yet some of the kindred of <hi>Maximianus</hi> conspired treason against him, but thorow the mercy of God (who in a wonderfull manner revealed all their conspiracies to <hi>Constantine</hi> by visions &amp; revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) they were prevented. God also gave him much peace &amp; safety, whereby he delighted himselfe in the love of his subjects, but chiefely to see the Church of God in a flourishing Condition, and so continuing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117874:16"/> to the tenth yeare of his raigne, he celebrated publick and solemne Festivalls, wherein he offered up prayers and praises unto God. But as his fame increased in the minds of most, so was it much maligned by <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> his fellow Emperour, who sought an occasion against <hi>Constantine,</hi> by raising a cruell persecution in the East against Christians, whom he never favoured <note place="margin">A Tyrant.</note> in his heart, though for a time he had suffered them in the exercise of their religion: and besides he plotted many treasons against <hi>Constantine,</hi> to whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them, whereby they were prevented: then by fained and crafty accusations he raised a persecution against the godly ministers, prohibiting them from meeting together in Synods to consult about matters concerning their owne, and the Churches good, and thereby seeking to breake off and interrupt the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious agreement of the Church, which could not <note place="margin">The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</note> belong preserved without such meetings, wherin great and weighty matters of controversie were fairely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and determined. Then he banished all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men out of his Court, others hee degraded from their dignity, and employed them in Servile offices: he sought to inrich himselfe by the spoiles of others: he threatened with death those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the name of Christ; he committed many adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and held that noe man could live chastly, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring others dispositions, by his owne vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>Then he made a Law, that men and women should <note place="margin">Tyranny.</note> not be present together at divine service: that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops should not expound the scripture to women, but that women should chuse women to be their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117874:17"/> and preachers: then he commanded the congregatiōs to meet together without the City gates in the open fields: such souldiers as would not sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Devills he put out of their places and offices: He forbad any to relieve those that lay in prison and were almost famished, yea he made a Law that such as did relieve them, should be imprisoned themselues. His avarice was insatiable, taxing the lands of his <note place="margin">Avarice.</note> subjects, thereby filling his treasury with silver and gold, and yet complayning of his poverty. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly banished many and confiscated their goods: he made his servants to abuse the wives of Noble men, and then to accuse them. Himselfe defloured virgins, and fell to open persecution of the Church, especially of the ministers, the chiefest of whom he caused secretly to be murthered. Some Churches he wholly demolished, and caused others to be shut up, that the congregations might not meet in them: he invented new kinds of tortures for the Christians; <note place="margin">Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> some he caused to be cut into small peeces, &amp; so to be throwen into the Sea to feed fishes. But the afflictions of the Church coming to the eares of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who saw that he could not otherwise prevent them, this Champion of God presently raised military forces, so that many Troops of horse &amp; foot resorted to him to follow his Christian Standard against the Tyrant, and by way of preparation, he betooke himselfe to prayer, and chose some godly ministers to attend him; esteeming them as his souls guard. On the contrary, <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> the Tyrant hearing that <hi>Constantine</hi> had undertook (by Gods assistance) to free the Christians from his Tyranny, &amp; had got religious men about him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117874:17"/> him, and sent for the Egyptian conjurers and magicians, and their Priests to sacrifice to his false Gods, and to enquire the successe of his warr, who all with one consent promised, that he should prosper and be victorious; and thus trusting to their promises, he marched forward, and prepared to joyne battel: the two Armies met in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a little before the Battell, <hi>Licinius</hi> calling his friends and favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites into a grove where were many Idolls, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lighted up waxen Tapers, and made his usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all sacrifices to them, he said, <hi>My friends, these are our country Gods, which wee from our successors doe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously worship, our enemie, violating the ancient customs and blinded with errour, worships a strange God, which wickedly he conceiveth to be the true God: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose Colours he intend's to fight, and beareth his Standard before his Army. In confidence of whose assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he warreth against us and our Gods, whom he hath traiterously forsaken, and relinquished the worship of them. Now it will appeare whether of us is in an error: for if wee have the victory, wee shall know that our Gods preserve and assist us: if</hi> Constantines <hi>strange God shall give him the victory over us, who are many more then they, we shall thereby know which God ought to be reverenced, &amp;c.</hi> And having ended his Oration, he commanded his Souldiers strait to give batttaile to the enemy. About this very time, in some of those Cities which were subject to <hi>Licinius,</hi> the Citizens <note place="margin">Prodigies.</note> thought that they saw Troops and bands of men, of <hi>Constantines</hi> Army marching at noon-day thorow the City, as if they had gotten the victory. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> having made his prayers to God, joyned Battel, <note place="margin">Prayer powerfull.</note>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:117874:18"/> with <hi>Licinius,</hi> and gave him a great overthrow: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his enemies cast away their weapons, and fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe at his feet, craved mercy, which he will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly granted them: <hi>Licinius</hi> forsaken of his forces, and finding by experience, that the confidence which he reposed in his false Gods was fruitlesse, fled away, and <hi>Constantine</hi> forbad his Souldiers to pursue him, hoping that the sence of his present calamity would make him leave off his wicked courses, and convert him to a milder temper: but he escaping into <hi>Asia</hi> the lesse, consults againe with conjurers, is confident of successe promised by them, raiseth an other Army, which <hi>Constantine</hi> being informed of, devoted himself for a time to prayer, and having erected a Tabernacle <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> distant from his Tents, he gave himselfe to godly meditation &amp; prayer, some other faithfull &amp; religious men accompanying him in these religious exercises: and so marching against his enemies, they came to a second battell, where he slue many, got the victory, and carried away many Trophies: yet he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his souldiers to shew mercy to the Captives, and to expresse humanity towards them, yea him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe payed their ransom, whereby they were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <note place="margin">Clemency</note>
                        <hi>Licinius</hi> being taken prisoner, by the mediation of his wife <hi>Constantia,</hi> had his life spared, and was confined to the City of <hi>Nicomedia:</hi> but he after a while practising new treasons, was at last by command of <hi>Constantine</hi> put to death: whereupon the peace of Gods Saints manifestly appeared, and the Gospell of Christ had a free progresse: for no sooner was <note place="margin">Peace of the Church.</note> the blasting tempest of persecution blowne over, but the faithfull Christians, who before had hidden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117874:18"/> in woods, &amp; deserts, &amp; secret caves, came forth, reedified the Churches, celebrated Festivall dayes to God with pure hearts, and faith unfained: and now the whole Roman Empire enjoying peace, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion spred abroad her bright beames to illuminate those which sate in darkenesse, and the shadow of death: former miseries were forgotten, and God was praysed as the author of this happinesse: Then were <hi>Constantines</hi> proclamations sent abroad to call home those that were banished out of their Countries: those which had beene condemned to slavery were freed; their goods which had been confiscated were restored: such as for their constancy in religion had <note place="margin">A good Prince.</note> been discarded out of their military offices, were put into their places againe, and such as were condemned to the servility of feminine imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he enfranchised from such base subjection: He made Lawes to redresse the grievances of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: enacted that the goods of those which had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Martyrdome should be restored to their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or if they had none, to the Church: By his edicts sent abroad into all Nations in Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, he acknowledged that God was the owner, and <note place="margin">Humility.</note> donour of all things, and that by his owne strength he had not obtained the victory, but by Gods assistance to whom hee ascribed the glory: He also enacted that the Church lands and goods that had beene injuriously taken away, though <note place="margin">Bounty to the Church.</note> now belonging to his owne Crowne, should bee restored: that such as had purchased Church lands, or goods, though they had grievously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, yet out of his accustomed clemency he free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117874:19"/> forgave them, provided that they made present <note place="margin">Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> restitution of the same: Then he proceeded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer great dignities on the Christians, making them governours of provinces, &amp; prohibited the Heathens to sacrifice to Idols, or to erect their Images: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that Churches should be built, and enlarged, and that the charge thereof should be defrayed out of his owne Treasury: Having made himselfe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by his pious actions, a report was brought to him of a great faction which was growing up in the Church, which beginning in the Church of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> spred it selfe through <hi>Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church.</note> and many other Provinces, and Cities, the Bishops writing, and inveighing one against another: this fire was first kindled by <hi>Arrius,</hi> which grieved <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> as much as if himselfe had falne into some great calamity, whereupon presently he chose one about him, who had been a zealous and faithfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor <note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</note> of the truth in times of persecution, whom he sent to <hi>Alexandria</hi> to draw them to peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, writing his Letters to the Authors of sedition to this purpose, that, Whereas all his designes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours had tended to bring all nations to agree in one opinion in matters of Religion, the rather that the Heathen by such an example might the sooner be converted: and whereas some rash, and seditious spirits, had by their errors made a schisme in the Church of <hi>Affrick,</hi> he had sent sober and religious Ministers to reconcile their factious spirits, and settle peace in the Church: but hearing that new factious seditions were sprung up amongst them, he was much grieved at it, and now wrote to them, profering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117874:19"/> to arbitrate, and moderate their mutuall dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not doubting, through the helpe of God, and assistance of godly and learned men, to reconcile their differences, and settle peace amongst them againe: And saith he, <hi>Whereas I was at</hi> Nicomedia <hi>purposing a journey into the East, the receipt of your letters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted my intentions, being unwilling to behold that, which I was grieved to heare of, viz. your contentions, therfore by your concord, &amp; agreement open me a passage into the East, where your dissentions have shut me out, and let me see a joyfull agreement amongst you, that all of us being reconciled together may praise and glorifie God.</hi> The messenger did not only deliver the letter, but dealt very earnestly with them for the setling of peace, yet he could not bring it to passe, the faction being growne so strong, that it was spred all over the Easterne Provinces, the Devill envying the happinesse of the Church, caused this discord &amp; contention still to continue: The first originall of it was this, <hi>Arrius</hi> a <note place="margin">Arian He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</note> Presbyter in the City of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a man which outwardly made a great shew of holinesse, denied the eternity of the Sonne of God with the father, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was not of the same substance with him: at the same time <hi>Alexander</hi> a man of great holinesse and learning, was Bishop in that City, who being of a gentle and mild condition, endeavoured to have cured <hi>Arrius</hi> of that heresie, praying and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing him to leave his errors: but he being of a proud and insolent nature, persisted therein, and drew many followers after him, hereupon <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> proceeded to excommunicate him, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing nothing, <hi>Alexander</hi> acquainted the Emperour
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117874:20"/> with it, saying that the mischiefe was growne so great that it required a great and speedy remedy: <hi>Constantine</hi> understanding that these divisions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and amongst the <hi>Thebans,</hi> in so much as the people grew tumultuous, killing and murthering one another, and commiting many other outrages: and an other division sprang up also at the same time concerning the Celebration of Easter. Hereupon he called a generall Councell in the City of <hi>Nicea</hi> in the province of <hi>Bithinia</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Generall Councell.</note> sent abroad his Writs into everie province, the Bishops and ministers repaired cheerefully to that place, some hoping that a universall peace would be established, others desiring to see this godly Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Here were congregated out of <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> three hundred and eighteene Bishops, besides Presbyters, and Deacons, whereof some were famous for their doctrine: some for their gravity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy: some for their experience, and age: some for their acutenesse and ingenuity: and all had their Diet allowed them by the Emperour: who himselfe in person was present amongst them: Upon the day appointed to begin the Councell, they all assembled in the hall of the Emperours pallace, were seats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set on both sides, they tooke their places according to their degrees and dignity: then came the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with an humble countenance, and modest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, whereupon they all rose up; at the upper end of the hall he stood a while, and would not sit downe, till he had given a signe to the Bishops to sit downe also: then one of the chiefest of them made a briefe speech to the Emperour, and recited an hymne of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117874:20"/> thanksgiving unto God: whereupon the Emperour spake to this purpose. <hi>It was my desire (deare friends) to convocate you in a generall Councell, and seeing you now assembled, I give God thanks for it; Let not therfore any private envie deprive us of that good which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by this meeting: and God having made us victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over the Tyrants, let not the Divells tares of dissention spring up to the disturbance of the peace of the Church: for tbese are of worse consequence then warr; for that kills the body, the other destroyes the soule: I rejoice to see you here together, but shall much more rejoyce to see unitie in affection, and concord amongst you, which being men devoted to Gods service, you ought to desire, and to encourage others by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to embrace peace, and concord: I intreat you therefore, beloued ministers of God and servants of Christ, take away the causes of dissention, cut off this Hydra's head of heresie, and establish peace, so shall you please god, and me your fellow servant in the Lord.</hi> But amongst so many Bishops, though many were good, and holy men, yet others there were full of envie and contention, whereupon they accused one another to the Emperour: exhibiting their complaints to him in writing: but he calling them before him, burnt their informations, that none should see them, and said unto them; <hi>Fathers, and ministers, God hath called you to the ministry, and thereby hath given you power in an orderly way to iudg me, but you cannot be judged by me, wherefore I referr your controversies to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God and the Councell; Wherefore setting apart all malice &amp; discord, for Gods sake applie your selves to peace, &amp; to the forgetting of all these private injuries.</hi> In
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117874:21"/> the Councell also he perswaded some, pacified others, praised others, and endeavoured to bring them all to concord, and agreement, and so at length by Gods blessing he brought most of them to unity in opinion in all points of controversie, that they did not only agree in matters of faith, but also of one certaine time for the celebration of Easter: to which decrees they all set their hands, and they were ingrossed as the determinate Acts of the Councell: <hi>Arrius</hi> and his wicked sect were condemned by all the Bishops, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept seventeene, which held with him, whereof elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven afterwards recanted, and <hi>Arrius</hi> with the other six were excommunicate, and banished by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: <note place="margin">Hereticks banished.</note> and so was the holy and Christian Councell dissolved: After which the good Emperour affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had obtained a second victory against the enemie of the Church, having now raigned twentie yeares, made a great feast to the honor, and glory of God, and invited the Bishops thereunto, and some <note place="margin">Ministers loved and honoured.</note> of them he placed at his owne table, the rest at tables on either hand him: the feast being ended, he gave gifts, and presents to all the Bishops, and by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters divulged, and confirmed the Councells Acts, and and by his decrees enjoined submission to the same: when he dismissed the Bishops, he made a speech to them, admonishing them to preserve peace, to avoid contention, not to envie one another for gifts, or wisdome, but to esteeme their abilities as a common good. His next care was to demolish, and pull downe Idolatrous Temples and Images: as the Groue and Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> which was a schoole of wickednesse, to those which were addicted to lust, <note place="margin">Zeale.</note>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:117874:21"/> where men and women frequently committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, fornications, &amp;c. <hi>Constantine</hi> thinking it unfit that the Sun should behold such villany, sent a Band of souldiers to suppresse it: as also the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> and the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> at <hi>Heliopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> and many such like in other places. But the Divell envying the prosperity of the Church, raised a new Sedition in <hi>Antioch,</hi> were the whole City was divided into two factions about the choice of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and were so madd against each other, that had not <hi>Constantine</hi> interposed, they had destroied one <note place="margin">Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> another: to them therefore he sent Ambassadours to pacifie their Fury, advising them by letters to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve peace, and approve themselves dutiful subjects, perswading them to referr their cause to him, and that they should not seek the Bishop of an other Church, but should choose him for their Bishop, whom God of his providence had appointed them: the Bishop, whom they desired, was <hi>Eusebius,</hi> Bishop, of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> but the Emperour wrote one letter to them to disswade them from that choice, and an other to <hi>Eusebius</hi> to commend him for refusing of it: to end this controversie a Synod was called, and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> wrote to them to doe all things according to the <note place="margin">A Synod.</note> prescript of Gods word, commending some to them, whom he judged fit for the place. He endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to extirpate and root out all Heresies, writing to the <hi>Valentinians, Marcionists, Cataphrigians, &amp;c</hi> that their doctrine was false, and seditious, that they were enemies to truth, and eternall life: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Heresies not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> that he would not suffer that Contagion to spread further, seeing the whole and sound were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117874:22"/> daily infected with their pestilent errours, but would severely punish the offenders and delinquents: then he enacted that none of them should meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Conventicles: that the Churches, where they used to meet, should be demolished and confiscated to the Catholick Church, and other places of their meeting converted to the use of the commonwealth, commanding that from that day, they should have noe places of meeting, neither publick nor private: hereby many being brought to a sight of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, publickly manifested their repentance, and so were againe received into the Church. He was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for Iustice, neither denying, nor delaying any <note place="margin">Justice.</note> iust and reasonable petitioners. He remitted to the owners of Land the fourth part of such rents as were formerly paid him: he mitigated the heavy <note place="margin">Mercy.</note> tributes, and being unwilling that such as were cast in suits of Law, should be utterly undone, he freely bestowed on them both lands and money. He thought it unfit, that any one admitted into the presence of his Imperiall majesty should goe heavily out of his presence. And as his care was to advance Gods glory, God also highly advanced him, by making him victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">Gods goodnesse.</note> over the <hi>Scythians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sauromatians:</hi> Ambassadors came to him from all nations, presenting him with pretious gifts, and offering him from their Kings, if he pleased, to serve him in all his warrs: he returned gifts to the Ambassadours, and dignifyed the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with Roman honours, so that some of them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Romane civility, and never returned into their owne countreys againe: the King of <hi>Persia</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ambassadours with rich presents to him, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117874:22"/> to renew their League: he returned them with farr richer gifts; and understanding, that many Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans suffered persecution under him, he wrote effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to him in their behalfe, desiring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into his protection; for (saith he) <hi>by dealing graciously with them, you shall doe me and your selfe a great benefit.</hi> He knowing how effectuall the prayer of faith was, did not only frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate himselfe before God in private, but commanded <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> and desired the publick prayers of the Church also in his behalfe. He made his Court a church where pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were made, and the Scriptures were read, and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pounded daily. He made Lawes for the strict observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord day, commanding, that through <note place="margin">Lawes for Sabbath.</note> all the Romane Empire all worke and Labour should be forborne. He prescribed a forme of prayer to the Legions of souldiers to be used both on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and other daies: He prohibited the adoration of Images; as also the single combats of Sword play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who slew one another to make the people pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime: and whereas the Egyptians worshipped the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note>
                        <hi>Nilus</hi> with many superstitious Ceremonies, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that otherwise the river would not overflow, he forbad it upon paine death, and that wicked custome being put downe, the river overflowed the country, and made it more fruitfull then formerly: And whereas certaine uniust Laws were made against those that were childlesse, he abolished them, and enacted that their inheritances should descend to those that were next of Kin to them. He ordained that the determination of Synods should be a binding <note place="margin">Synods Acts bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> rule for deciding of Ecclesiasticall controversies.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117874:23"/> He endowed, and much enriched the churches of of God: Meeting with a covetous man, he said, <hi>O good man, when will thy thirst of covetousnesse be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,</hi> and having drawne forth with his speare the measure of a mans stature upon the ground, he said <hi>If thou hadst at home all the wealth, and treasure of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Folly of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>

But whilst he was thus busie for the Churches good, the Devill stirred up new factions, and divisions in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereupon he assembled a Synod, commanding them speedily to <note place="margin">A Synod.</note> to determine, and end those controversies: he sent his Delegate to it with authority, that if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned his command in not coming to it, he should banish him.

Falling into some distemper, he resolved to goe to the warme Baths, but fell sick at <hi>Hellenopolis,</hi> and finding his end to approach, he humbly confessed his sinns to God: and (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith) was there Baptized, but most probably he was long before Baptized at Rome, and so quietly resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned up his spirit unto God, in the three and thirtieth yeare of his raigne, of his age sixtie six: <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 342: Till his last sicknesse his body continued strong and lusty, not troubled with any disease, paine, or infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: <note place="margin">Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines character.</note> He was of a comely presence and aspect, and

                     <p>He made, and penned holy prayers to his dying day: He removed the Imperiall seat from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Byzantium</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> which he adorned with stately <note place="margin">Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineople.</note> edifices, and priviledges above other Cities: he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, &amp; adorned it with the spoiles of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, pillars, Colosses, and all other things that were singular, and excellent, either of stone or mettall; the like he did from other Cities also: he built in it a stately Pallace, a most magnificent Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he erected his owne Tomb: A famous Library, wherein he put an hundred and twentie thousand of the chiefest written books, and in the middest thereof were the guts of a Dragon of one hundred and twentie foot long, whereupon was admirably written in letters of gold <hi>Homers Iliads:</hi> His death was much bewailed amongst all sorts of persons: his Guard, amd officers tore their garments, cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the ground, beat their heads against the pavement, crying out that they had lost a gracious L. &amp;c. the Centurions, and Captaines bewailed the losse of their Generall: the Souldiers of their shepherd: the people ran about the City with weeping and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: when the Senate, and Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> heard of it, they shut up their Baths, prohibited all publick plaies, and recreations, lamenting and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning excessiuely.</p>
                     <p>He vsed to shew much reverence, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the word of God preached, so that many <note place="margin">Reverence to the word of God.</note> times he would stand up all the Sermon while, and when some of his Courtiers told him, that it would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117874:24"/> tend to his disparagement, he answered, that it was in the service of the great God, who is noe respecter of persons: He used to kiss the hollow of old <hi>Paphnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his eie which he had lost for the cause of Christ in the former persecutions: the daies of this Godly Emperours reigne, were the breathing daies of the persecuted Church: and in his time the Gospell was propagated into <hi>East India</hi> by <hi>Frumentius,</hi> and <hi>Ede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi> As also into <hi>Iberia</hi> in the uttermost part of the <note place="margin">Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note>

                     <p>He vsed to say, that <hi>an Emperour should refuse noe labour for the benefit of the common wealth: as also, That</hi>

                     <p>So studious he was of peace, that when any Bishops or Ministers brought complaints one against another, he would take their bills of complaint, and burne them before their faces, and withall so tender he was of their honour, that he used to say, that if he saw a Bishop committing wickedness, he would rather cast the skirt of his gowne over him to cover it, then by speaking of it to dishonour his holy calling.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Iovianus</hi> was of an excellent wit, sound judgment, given to study, well learned, and withall a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christian, insomuch, as when <hi>Iulian</hi> commanded that noe Christian should be a Captaine, neither <note place="margin">Constancy</note> should have any Charge, or office in the warrs, <hi>Iovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:117874:26"/> pleasantly said, that he made greater account of the faith, whereof he made profession, then of any dignity, or honour that he enjoyed, and so he gave up his charge, chusing rather to throw away his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Belt, the ensigne of his honour, then to doe sacrifice, or satifie the wicked edict of the Emperour. Yet afterwards <hi>Iulian</hi> (when the necessitie of the Persian warrs constrained him) reassumed him into the number of his Captaines: This <hi>Iovianus</hi> being chosen Emperour, considering that <hi>Iulian</hi> had drawne the men of warr of his Army to commit Idolatry, and to sacrifice to Devills, he in a publick Oration which he made to them said, <hi>That although he might,</hi>

                        <hi>yet he would not, being a Christian, be an Emperour of Infidels,</hi> and so he resisted, and absolutely refused the Empire. But all the Army was so well pleased with the election, that they cryed out aloud, saying, wee are all Christians, and for his sake, they that were not so, resolved to become Christians, upon condition that he would accept the Empire, which he then consented to; They all with incredible joy, and gladnesse sware obedience unto him, and gave him the Imperiall ensignes: whereupon he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, and reinforced the Army: but <hi>Sapor</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> gathering together the greatest Forces that he could make, did so molest, and inviron them that they were glad to come to an agreement with him, though somewhat to the dishonor of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but it was the best end that he could make in those straits whereinto <hi>Iulian</hi> by his pride had brought the Army. Then he marched into <hi>Soria;</hi> the Christians everie where wonderfully rejoicing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117874:27"/> at his election, and his first worke was by proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Piety.</note> to call home all those Bishops which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iled for opposing the Arrian Heresie, or on any other unlawfull occasion, whom he restored to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer places, and principally the great <hi>Athanasius.</hi> He also revoked, and made voide all the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and decrees made by <hi>Iulian</hi> against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ordained that they should be admitted to offices, dignities, magistracy, and studie as in the daies of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great: He caused to be paid to the Churches those rents of corne, and other things that <hi>Constantine</hi> had given them, and which, by the command of <hi>Iulian</hi> had beene sequestred. Then he caused the Idol-groves, and Temples to be shut up, and the Pagans wandred about hiding <note place="margin">Zeale.</note> themselves here and there: the bloodie and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sacrifices used in <hi>Julians</hi> time, he wholly tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

His losse was much bewailed of all good men. He used to wish that <hi>he might governe wise men, and that wise men might governe him.</hi> He resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Christian faith in everie part of his Empire: streightly commanding all the Idoll Temples to be shut up, which his predecessor <hi>Iulian</hi> had opened, and upon great penalties forbad all manner of Gentilitious sacrifices: he called home from banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that worthy Captaine <hi>Ʋalentinian,</hi> whom <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> had banished: He resolved to follow the advice

                     <p>For his personage, he was of a goodly presence, both <note place="margin">

He (although he was otherwise a man of rare and singular parts) yet was no body in controversies, but appointed <hi>Sisinius,</hi> a minister of his Church, to reason with them in his stead: <hi>Sisinius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a well experienced man, knew that disputations would not only not reconcile schismes, but rather exasperate mens spirits and inflame contentions, therefore he advised <hi>Nectarius</hi> after this sort: that instead of disputation, the Emperour should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ringleaders of the Hereticks, whether they esteemed the ancient Fathers that lived before this Schisme sprang up, or whether they condemne them? If they owne them, saith he, out of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings wee can confirme the truth, and confute these men: If they reject them, all men will crie out upon them: <hi>Nectarius</hi> liking this advice, reported it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to the Emperour, who approving of it also, he presently demanded of all the Hereticks, whether they esteemed and allowed the fathers, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Church before them, and would be tried by their testimonies touching the true and right faith? They hearing this, knew not what answer to make, and so were divided amongst themselves: whilst some would assent to the Emperour, others dissented: yea they that were of one opinion, were divided amongst themselves; the Emperour percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that they relied not upon the ancient Fathers exposition of the faith, but upon their owne witt, and quirks of Logick, he bad everie sect to lay downe their faith and opinion in writing: which accordingly they did, and brought them to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117874:31"/> the Emperour received them curteously, and then retired into his closet, fell downe upon his <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> knees before God, humbly beseeching him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale the truth unto him, and to assist him in finding of it out; then perusing everie ones opinion, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously weighing of it in the ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, he condemned and tore in peeces all those Creeds that derogated from the unity that is in the blessed Trinity, allowing &amp; highly commending the other: the Sectarian Bishops, becuse there raigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them mutuall discords &amp; dissention, were set at nought even of their owne people and party. Thus as <hi>Theodosius</hi> was carefull to build Gods house, the Lord built him an house, and prospered him in all his enterprizes: for about this time, the <hi>Alanes</hi> and <hi>Hunns</hi> [people of <hi>Scythia]</hi> entred againe into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gods goodnesse.</note> against whom the Emperour went with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; he fought many cruell battailes with them, and in them all had the upper hand, slaying an infinite number of them, and driving the rest out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the Empire: insomuch as <hi>Athanaricus,</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> offered himselfe and his people to doe him service, &amp; <hi>Theodosius</hi> not being willing to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire his men of war, granted him peace, and so taking <hi>Athanaricus</hi> with him, he returned victoriously to his City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where <hi>Athanaricus</hi> behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the Emperour, the solemnity and greatnesse of his Court; the riches, furniture, and order of his house, and service, he said, that truly the Roman Emperour was God on the earth, and represented the God of heaven, against whom none ought to be so hardy, as to lift up his hand, or heart,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117874:31"/> except he would presently be condemned to death: not long after <hi>Athanaricus</hi> fell sick, and dyed, but the <hi>Goths</hi> that served in his house and Army, having had experience of the goodnesse and bounty of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> desired to continue in his service, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried themselves faithfully and valiantly in all his warrs: But <hi>Gratian,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> ruling in the West very remisly and negligently, gave occasion to the Brittish Legions to rebell and chuse an excellent Captaine, one <hi>Maximus,</hi> for their Emperour, who thereupon presently marched into <hi>France,</hi> where <hi>Gratian</hi> was, who being ill beloved of his Souldiers, many of them forsook him, and went to <hi>Maximus;</hi> hereupon <hi>Gratian</hi> resolved to retire into <hi>Italy,</hi> but being circumvented by the policy of <hi>Maximus,</hi> he was slaine in the way, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 387. <hi>Maximus</hi> marching forward with a great Army into <hi>Italy, Ʋalentinian</hi> the Emperour knowing his owne weaknesse, deserted it, and went to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> to intreat aide: who compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating his condition, of his naturall and accustomed valour, resolved to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> to revenge the death of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and to restore <hi>Valentinian</hi> to his Empire, and thereupon, leaving his sonne <hi>Arcadius</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and taking <hi>Valentinian</hi> along with him, he raised the greatest and best forces he could, and so marched through <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where <hi>Maximus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready was, having left <hi>Androgathius</hi> generall of his Army to resist <hi>Thedosius,</hi> who expecting that he would come by Sea into <hi>Italy,</hi> he embarked all his Army aboord a great number of Ships and barks, purposing to overthrow <hi>Theodosius</hi> upon the water:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117874:32"/> the valiant <hi>Theodosius,</hi> being advertised hereof, March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by long journeies, finding the passages open, into <note place="margin">Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse.</note> the plaines of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> &amp; besieged the City of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia</hi> were <hi>Maximus</hi> was, and compassing the City round about, they within it, having guilty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and being full of feare, delivered <hi>Maximus</hi> into <hi>Theodosius</hi> hands, without staying for any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, or fight, who caused him as a Traitor to his Prince, to be put to death: when <hi>Androgathius,</hi> his Generall, being vpon the Sea with a very mighty navie, heard of it, he was so overcome with sorrow and despaire, that he cast himselfe overboord, and drowned himselfe, and thereupon his Army yielded themselves to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and so without either slaughter or bloodshed, God gave unto his holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Theodosius,</hi> a very great victory: and from <hi>France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Brittaine</hi> there came Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to him, yielding him their obedience with great humility and devotion. Thence he marched with <hi>Ʋalentinian</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they received him with a solemne Triumph; He continued there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies, reformed many abuses, &amp; disorders, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed punishments, and did Iustice upon sundry wicked <note place="margin">Justice.</note> and dissolute persons, and as an holy and faithfull Christian, he reformed the abuses of the Church also: and setting all things in good order, he returned to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> leaving with <hi>Ʋalentinian</hi> an Army and power sufficient to defend his Empire. <hi>Theodosius,</hi> through Gods mercy, and goodnesse, was so feared, and honoured by all nations, that the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> notwithstanding his former victories, in great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sent his Ambassadours to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117874:32"/> a perpetuall League, and peace with him, and he seeing with how great submission that potent King sued for peace, granted it.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour went into <hi>France,</hi> and there living in prosperity, and void of care, one <hi>Argobastes,</hi> a Captaine of his, conspired with <hi>Eugenius</hi> to kill him, and for that end suborned some of his Eunuches to strangle him in his bed, which they did, publishing abroad, that he had hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: whereupon <hi>Argobastes</hi> nominated and made <hi>Eugenius</hi> Emperour: <hi>Theodosius</hi> being advertised of this fact, was very sorry, and much troubled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how dangerous a warre lay before him, yet thinking it a great dishonour to suffer such an action to goe unpunished, he mustered up his Army, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his son <hi>Arcadius</hi> in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble speed he marched against them; but as a good <note place="margin">Fasting &amp; Prayer.</note> and holy Christian, he first betooke himselfe to fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, seeking unto God, the giuer of Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for successe in his interprise, requesting the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other holy men also, whereof one of them sent him word, that he should have the victory, but should die in <hi>Italy,</hi> and never returne againe to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> When <hi>Theodosius</hi> with his Army came to the confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Tyrants had such great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and had taken such good order for all matters, that all the passages of the Alps were stopped, and at the foot thereof they attended his coming with all their forces: yet <hi>Theodosius</hi> having overcome those passages, and being entred into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> found himselfe much distressed, the enemies being more in number, and having as valiant and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:117874:33"/> souldiers as he; who compassed him about, &amp; kept all victualls from being brought to his Camp: but the valiant Emperour using the best meanes he could, as a faithfull Christian, expected and hoped for his best reliefe from God, to whom with teares he made continuall supplications: and truly his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">Prayer Powerfull.</note> was so great, that had not God miraculously fought for him, he had there beene lost: the night before the battaile he spent wholly in prayer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eating nor sleeping, &amp; the next day, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe charged on everie side, he set his men in very good order to fight, with great courage and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attending the coming of his enemies, and iust as the battaile was ready to begin, behold the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God: <hi>Arbicius</hi> a Captaine of the enemies cam over to his side with all under his Charge. The Battaile beginning, where Romans were against Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, they fought at even hand, most cruelly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and killing one another. But <hi>Theodosius</hi> his Auxiliaries were worsted, and at the first charge ten thousand <hi>Goths,</hi> which were in his pay, were slaine, which when he saw, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and with a true faith and stedfast hope, shedding many teares, prayed unto the Lord, that he might not be overthrowne in so just a cause. At that instant a Captaine of his, with a great troope of Souldiers came to the rescue of certaine Squadrons, which in all shew were overthrowne, and they charged the enemy with such courage and resolution, that they which were in a manner vanquished, recovered strength and heart againe: But the enemies were so many, that it seemed impossible for them to defend themselves, at which <note place="margin">A miracle of Mercy.</note>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:117874:33"/> instant it pleased God to send them succour from heaven, for suddenly there arose so violent a wind and tempest, as the like had never been seene by any man then living, which without annoyance to the Emperours Army, did beate into the enemies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with such force, that it bereaved them of their sight, so that they were not able to march forwards, yea the wind was so strong, that all the Arrowes, stones, darts, and lances, which they threw and shot, were borne back againe, wounding those that threw them: the most Christian Emperour taking notice of this miraculous providence of God, rendered thankes <note place="margin">Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> unto him for the same, encouraging, and animating his souldiers, so as in a short space they obtained a compleate victory: <hi>Eugenius</hi> himselfe was taken fighting, and brought to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be slaine for his treason, and <hi>Argobastes</hi> flying, and finding no certaine place of refuge, with his owne sword cut his owne throat: <hi>Theodosius</hi> had the spoyle of his enemies Campe: presently after, all the Princes of the Empire sent their Embassadours to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> to congratulate his victory, and many barbarous nations did the like, so that he remained the absolute Lord both of the East, and West: and being freed from warres, he came to <hi>Millaine,</hi> where Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> was the Bishop, in which place he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the rest of his time, applying himselfe to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Governement, whereof in the time of warre he neglected not to take great care. Being thus in <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,</hi> meditating upon his mortality by reason of his diseases, he resolved to settle his estate, and sending to <hi>Constantinople</hi> for his sonne <hi>Honorius,</hi> by the generall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117874:34"/> approbation of all, he made him Emperour of the West: and his elder sonne <hi>Arcadius</hi> of the East, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he lived in great prosperity three yeares in <hi>Millaine,</hi> in the company of that holy man <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> during which time this fell out. In <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> [a richand populous City of <hi>Macedonia]</hi> there happened a great tumult amongst the people against the magistrates and governours under the Emperour, and their fury grew so great, that they slew them, which when <hi>Theodosius</hi> understood, he was so incensed against them, that he made his souldiers put to death seven thousand of the common people, making noe difference betweene the guilty and innocent: <hi>Ambrose</hi> hearing of it, when the Emperour came to Church, as his manner was, <hi>Ambrose</hi> (that his repentance <note place="margin">Zeale.</note> might be as publick as his offence) set himselfe in the Church doore, and told the Emperour, that he should not enter there, making a learned Oration to him, wherein he opened his fault, and then excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated him: all which the Emperour heard with great patience, and returning to his palace he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there eight months before he was absolved, at the end whereof he said to one about him, truly I will goe and see what penance my Pastor will lay upon me for my offence, and so he went to the Church doore where <hi>Ambrose</hi> was, intreating him to absolue him. <hi>But what repentance hast thou shewed</hi> (said the Bishop) <hi>for so hainous an offence?</hi> and <hi>with what salue hast thou healed so mortall a wound? Thou</hi> (said the Emperour) <hi>art to instruct, and shew me</hi>

                        <hi>what I am to doe, and thou shalt see that I will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish what thou shalt prescribe:</hi> the Bishop seeing the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117874:34"/> Emperours mildnesse, thinking it penance suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that he had bin so long excommunicated, with mild and curteous speeches, said unto him: <hi>Thy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Theodosius, shall be this, that seeing in thy hasty fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thou commitedst such an horrid murther, thou shalt presently establish a Law, that no man whom thou shalt adjudge to die shall be executed within thirtie dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou hast pronounced the sentence, at the end of which time thou shalt either ratifie or disanull thy sentence, as thou seest cause:</hi> the Emperour immediately caused this Law to be written, and proclaimed, which he ever after observed, and whereof much good ensued: and so being absolved, he came into the Church, prayed, and received the Sacrament, and ever after loved <hi>Ambrose</hi> very deerly, and used his counsell in many matters, and for his companies sake, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>Millaine</hi> the remainder of his life.</p>
                     <p>In the good Emperours absence, the <hi>Arians</hi> at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hereticks insolency.</note> began to waxe bold, raised tumults, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that insolency, that they set the house of <hi>Nectarius</hi> [Bishop of <hi>Constantinople]</hi> on fire: in other Cities also, where they were thrust out of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by the authority of the Emperour, they kept conventicles in the suburbs, and thereby much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated their damnable opinions: About this time the Emperour commanded that all the Idoll groues and Temples in <hi>Alexandria</hi> should be demolished, and that <hi>Theophilus</hi> the Bishop thereof should see it done, which he with much zeale prosecuted, which <note place="margin">Zeale.</note> so inraged the heathen, that they made head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ran upon the Christians, and sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them everie kinde of way: the Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117874:35"/> them, and so they fought till both sides were weary, many were slaine, and more wounded: But the heathens, when that the heate was over, were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully affraid of the Emperours displeasure, and therefore forsooke the City, and hid themselves in severall places: Afterwards the Governour and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Host assisted <hi>Theophilus</hi> in the overthrow of those Temples: all the Images by the Emperours order were given to the reliefe of the poore.</p>
                     <p>Whilst <hi>Theodosius</hi> was at <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">Justice.</note>
                        <hi>Maximus,</hi> he reformed two most abominable wickednesses: the first was this; In <hi>Rome</hi> was an huge house of ancient building, where all the bread that served the City was baked, and most of the roomes were under grownd: round about it were Taverns and Victualing houses full of Harlots, so that many that resorted thither, either to satisfie their hunger, or lust, were by these whores spoyled of all they had, and usually so made away that their friends could never heare of them more: for by privie conveiances, they were throwne into these back-houses, and there kept to grinding, and drudgery all their life after. It fell out that one of the Emperours Souldiers was thus throwne into this hole, who when, they would not suffer him to depart, drew his Dagger, and slew some that stopped his passage, so that the rest being afraid, let the Souldier goe: and the Emperour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed by him, sent for the Millers and Bakers, punished the Masters with extreame torments, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw those blind houses, and so rid the princely City of that shamefull doing. The other abuse which he reformed was this: If a woman were taken in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117874:35"/> they shut her up in a narrow Stewes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled her beastly, and without all shame to play the harlot, ringing a bell whilst the deed was doing, that all the neighbours might be made privie to it, which was so farre from removing the sin, that it encreased it rather: The good Emperour being informed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, caused the Stewes to bee pulled downe, and <note place="margin">Adultery punished.</note> wholely suppressed: and made other Lawes for the punishment of Adultery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theodosius</hi> being aged, &amp; infirme, at last fell extreme sick, and therefore he disposed of the Empire to his two sonnes; and because they were young, and not of fit yeares for such a burthen, he left, as tutors and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to them, two very sufficient men both for war &amp; peace: after he had set all things in order, his disease so increased, that being overcome by it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended his soule to God, and so departed out of this present life <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 397. of his age fifty, or as others sixty, and of his Empire seventeene. In all his <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter.</note> warres he was very valiant and politick▪ of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wit and judgement in civill governement, a lover of Justice and equity, very mercifull, and of a most noble inclination, yet somewhat hasty &amp; cholericke, but presently pacified, and easily intreated: To mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate his passion, besides <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Law in matters of death, he used (knowing his owne hasty dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) not to determine of any thing till he had repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the letters of the Greeke Alphabet, for in that space his wrath would be tempered: he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding liberall, temperate, and chast: he greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored learned, and wise men: hee was well spoken, and cheerefull in his deportment. His wife <hi>Flacilla</hi>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:117874:36"/> was an excellent, and most religious woman: He u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to say, <hi>That he accounted it a greater honour, that he</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Piety.</note>
                        <hi>was a member of the Church, then that he was the head of the Empire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He wrote out the whole New Testament with his owne hand, accounting it a great Jewell, and reading a part of it every day. Hee commanded that they which reviled, and spake evill of him should not bee punished: <hi>Quoniam si ex levitate processerit, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendum</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Meekenes.</note>
                        <hi>est: si ex insania, miseratione dignum: si ab injuria, remittendum est: Because if it proceeded of levity, it is not to be regarded: if of madnesse, it is to be pittied: if of an injury received, it is to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Emperors reigne there was much hurt done by earthquakes in sundry places: In the Imperiall City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> there were thrown downe at one time fifty seven Towers of the City wall, which were newly built a little before: It endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by fitts sixe moneths together, so that many faire and goodly Churches and Fortresses were demolished, and the Inhabitants were faigne to forsake their houses, and lie in the fields: It raged by Sea also, so that many ships, and whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands were swallowed up by it. After which, insued Famine and pestiferous aers, by which many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of people, and beasts perished: and in <hi>Cherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus,</hi> whole Parishes sunk into the ground: Also in the last yeare of his raigne in <hi>Epyrus</hi> there was a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon seene of that vast bignesse, that when he was dead eight yoaks of Oxen could hardly draw him. The Inhabitants of <hi>Antiochia</hi> overthrowing the brasen
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117874:36"/> portraiture of his beloved wife <hi>Placilla, Theodosius</hi> was so incensed against them for it, that he deprived their Towne of the dignity of a Metropolitan City, conferring it upon their neighbour towne of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea:</hi> he threatned also to burne it downe, but by the perswasions of <hi>Flavianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> the good Emperour moved with pitty, pardoned their fault.</p>
                     <p>At one time he was very favourable to the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whom he permitted to keepe Conventicles in his principall Cities, which <hi>Amphilochius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Iconium</hi> taking notice of, he came before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and did his reverence unto him, but not to his sonne <hi>Arcadius,</hi> though he was already made <hi>Augustus,</hi> whereat <hi>Theodosius</hi> being offended, <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lochius</hi> presently answered, that the God of heaven would also be offended with them, who tolerated the blasphemers of his only begotten sonne Iesus Christ: the Godly Emperour being hereby brought to a sight of his great sinne, presently made a Law prohibiting the Conventicles of the <hi>Arrians</hi> in all his Cities.</p>

About which time the Westerne Empire was much infested by the barbarians: but <hi>Theodosius</hi> being now of sufficient age, was freed from his tutours, and as he was a Godly man, and the inheritour of his grandfathers vertues, his chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est care was for the service of God and the defence and advancement of his Church; whereupon he fell <note place="margin">Piety.</note> out with <hi>Barrabanus</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> (who succeded <hi>Isdigerdus)</hi> because he persecuted the Christians that were in his dominions, and when perswasions would not prevaile, he sent <hi>Ardaburus</hi> an excellent Captaine against him, who fought a battaile with <hi>Nasius,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Persians,</hi> overthrew him, and made a great slaughter of his men, and afterwards entred his country, and made great spoile therein.

He lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much of the holy Scriptures without booke: He <note place="margin">Scriptures studied.</note> so reasoned of them with the Bishops, as if himselfe had beene an experienced minister: he gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a very great Library of the ancient Fathers works, but especially many books of the sacred scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <note place="margin">A great Library.</note> He excelled all men in patience, curtesie, and clemency: He learned to bridle his anger: to beare afflictions patiently: to revenge him of none that did him injury: &amp; whē one of his familiars asked him, why he would not put to death some that had wronged <note place="margin">Meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> him; He answered, <hi>I would to God it lay in my power to reviue them that are dead: indeed it is noe hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bereaue a man of his life, but when that is done, be a man never so sorry, he cannot revine him againe:</hi> when

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117874:40"/> of learned men. His house was like unto a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary for exercises of reading the holy Scriptures, and devout prayers: His facility in subscribing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read letters was corrected by the prudent advice of his sister <hi>Pulcheria:</hi> In his time <hi>Attila,</hi> entred into <hi>Italy,</hi> took, sacked and ruined <hi>Aquileia, Ticinum,</hi> and <hi>Millaine,</hi> and intended the same cruelty against <hi>Rome:</hi> but <hi>Leo</hi> Bishop hereof went forth to him, and with gentle words so mitigated his minde that he forbore to doe it.</p>
                     <p>He had a man whose name was <hi>Palladius,</hi> one that had rare gifts both outwardly in body, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in minde, and of that strength, and agilitie of body, that he was able in three daies to ride Post into the furthest bounds of the Romane &amp; Persian domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and back againe in the same space to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople:</hi> So that by his celerity he made the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire which was vast and wide, to be but narrow and straight.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Theodosius</hi> sent his Army under <hi>Ardaburius</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and for the reliefe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Christians there: the Citizens of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> were very sad and heavy, fearing the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able event of the warrs: but a company of Angells appeared to certaine in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> that were travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and willed them to bid the Citizens to be of good cheere, and to pray and put their trust in God: and that they should be confident of <hi>Ardaburius</hi> victory, for God had sent them as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and Soveraigne Captaines of the warrs.</p>
                     <p>The Heresie of <hi>Nestorius</hi> was so hatefull to him, that he made this Law concerning the followers of

And then he marched against Captain <hi>Iohn</hi> and his army, that was coming towards <hi>Rome,</hi> who shewed himselfe so very a coward, that he durst not stay his coming, but put himselfe into <hi>Otranto,</hi> whereby <hi>Totila</hi> tooke all <hi>Calabria, Abruzzo, and Lucania.</hi>

About nine a Clock the signall of battell being given, the fierce and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souldiers began to skirmish; but afterwards <note place="margin">The first days fight.</note> they fought Foot to Foot, and Hand to Hand for three houres; at which time the Christians put the right wing of the Turkes to the worst, and also in the left wing they did the like with great slaughter of the Turks. <hi>Amurath</hi> presently sent in strong supplies, whereupon the Christians light Horsemen, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before, retired to their men at Armes, who ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together, easily repulsed the Turkes, and made a great slaughter of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Huniades</hi> in the mean time with his Artillery from the Hill, did the Turks great harm; which <hi>Amurath</hi> perceiving, drew up his men close under the Hill, whereby that was prevented: <hi>Huniades</hi> encouraged his men, sometimes with cheerfull speech, sometimes with his own most valiant hand: to the weary he sent

The cruell fight maintained all the day, was by the comming of the night ended, both Armies retiring to their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and with little rest was that night spent: It was scarse faire day, when both the Armies orderly ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, began the battell againe: but the Christians had <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</note> almost spent their strength the day before, whereas there were fortie thousand Turks that had not fought at all: yet <hi>Huniades</hi> wonderfully encouraged his men by many arguments beseeching them for the love of God and man, with their wonted valour that day for ever to set at liberty themselves, their countrey, their wives, and children, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else they held deare unto them.</p>
                     <p>So that both the Armies being fully joyned, the battell was fought with no lesse force and fury then the day before: yea many of the wounded Christians came again into the battell, there either by speedy death, or speedy victory, to cure their wounds, and did excellent service.

In this battell the Turks lost foure and thirtie thousand men for eight-thousand of the Christians. <hi>Huniades</hi> all alone by uncouth wayes travelled three daies and nights without meat, or drink, and the fourth day tyred his horse, and cast him off: and afterwards being himselfe on foot disarmed, he fell into the hands of two notable thieves, who dispoiled him of his apparell, but falling <note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>Ohn,</hi> the Father of this <hi>George,</hi> was descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of an ancient Family, which had long reigned in <hi>Epyrus,</hi> or <hi>Albania,</hi> a part of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> yet he surmounted his predecessors, in prudence, gravity, and magnanimity; in corporall beauty, and comelinesse of person, and in many vertuous endowments: His
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117874:63"/> Mother was <hi>Voisava,</hi> daughter of the King of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullians,</hi> a woman for beauty, wisdome, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of spirit, surpassing most of her sex. God blessed these persons with nine Children; foure sons, and five daughters, whereof this <hi>George</hi> was the youngest, upon whose right arm, when he was born, appeared the form of a sword, as naturally imprinted, as if it had been engraven by the hands of a cunning Workman. About this time the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire had extended it selfe into <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Amurath</hi> the great Turke having long afflicted <hi>Macedonia</hi> with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and tedious warre: <hi>John Castriot,</hi> amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes, was fain to sue to him for peace; which he obtained upon condition, that he should deliver to him all his sonnes in hostage: which though it was very grievous, yet necessity forced assent. Thus was <hi>George,</hi> with his other brethren, delivered to the great Turk; who faithfully promised well and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably to intreat them: But this miscreant having them in his power, falsified his oath, and caused them to be circumcised; giving to <hi>George</hi> (in whom some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then ordinary appeared) at his circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the name of <hi>Scanderbeg; i. e. Lord Alexander:</hi> He was about nine yeares old, and <hi>Amurath</hi> taking a liking to him, appointed him good Masters and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structers, under whom he quickly learned the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish, Arabian, Greeke, Italian,</hi> and <hi>Sclavonian</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: <note place="margin">His lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and valour.</note> And as his strength increased, he acquainted himselfe with all those vertuous exercises which might fit him for the warre. And sometimes with his Sword, sometimes with his Bow, on Horse back and Foot, he gave forth incredible proofes of agility and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117874:64"/> readinesse of body, and of a forward and couragious spirit: Hereupon the Sultan made him a Sanziak, and Colonell of five thousand Horse: His brethren also proving very good Souldiers, he imploied them in severall parts of his Empire <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being eighteen years old, was sent by <hi>Amurath</hi> into <hi>Natolia;</hi> where, in his first enterprise, his vertue, and good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <note place="margin">Victorious in his first enterprise.</note> in warre appeared, and he returned victorious. And afterwards he, with his Regiment, alwayes made one in all enterprises; and the good successe was, by the common consent of all the Souldiery, still cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">His fame.</note> him, without the mention of other Commanders. And new troubles arising in <hi>Asia;</hi> he, at those yeares, was chosen Generall of the whole Army: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did easily surmount the glory of his former acts, by the quick and speedy defeat of his Enemies. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath</hi> wondred not so much at his happy successe, as at his wisdome and prudence. About this time came a Giant-like <hi>Scythian</hi> to the Court, demanding if there were any that durst encounter him in Armes and prove himselfe in fight against him. <hi>Amurath</hi> proclaimed and promised to the Conquerour a great reward, to encourage his men to undertake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. But when every one abhorred the purchase of honour upon such desperate conditions (for they <note place="margin">A Duell, wherein he slue a great Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian.</note> were to fight in their shirts in a narrow place with their swords onely) <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> stepping to him, said, <hi>Either shalt thou not, O Scythian, beare away this prize, and glory, or else being made more glorious by my death, thou shalt be enriched with these spoyles, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, &amp;c.</hi> In the Duell, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> slue the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> without receiving the least wound from him;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117874:64"/> and presenting his head to <hi>Amurath,</hi> received the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his victory.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards two <hi>Persians</hi> of a faire and goodly sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture came, and made the like challenge to fight on Horse back; and when all refused, he took up the Gantlet against them: and whereas (contrary to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement) <note place="margin">He slue two brave Persians</note> after his first course, they both assaulted him together; he so acquitted himselfe, that he slue them both, and presented their heads to <hi>Amurath;</hi> and both by the Emperour and his Bassa's, was admired and rewarded with great and bountifull presents. If at any time he was imployed against the Christians, and he could not evade it without suspition, he used to pray to God that it might be farre from him, to purchase honour by shedding the blood of Christi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ans: and therefore he ever sought as little as might be, to endammage them, and gave them opportunity to save themselves. Whatsoever money came to his <note place="margin">His boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> hands, he distributed it bountifully amongst his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                     <p>About this time died <hi>John Castriot</hi> in <hi>Epyre,</hi> which <hi>Amurath</hi> hearing of, seised upon his Kingdome, put Garisons into all the Cities and strong Holds, and poysoned all the brethren of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> which was <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Amuraths</hi> perfidious<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nesse.</note> an extream griefe to him, yet durst he not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the least signes of it, but carried himselfe, as if he had preferred <hi>Amurath</hi> before them all.</p>
                     <p>Yet the Tyrant grew jealous of him, and put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">As <hi>Saul</hi> did with <hi>David.</hi>
                        </note> all desperate services, hoping that by his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse he would perish in some of them; yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much interest he had in the affections of the men of Warre, he carried faire weather towards him.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:117874:65"/> But rather the admirable providence of God in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of him is to be taken notice of: for the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <note place="margin">Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vidence.</note> wanted not will, nor power, nor opportunities, nor provocations from his Court-Parasites to have taken away his life, but the Lord preserved him to be the delverer of his people, a bulwark to the Christians, and a scourge to that proud <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in her greatest height and glory.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, <hi>Amurath</hi> fell out with <hi>Ʋladislaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> for assisting the Despot of <hi>Misia,</hi> and thereupon raising an Army of eighty thousand men, he sent <hi>Canambey</hi> the Bassa of <hi>Romania</hi> with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and twentie thousand men to invade the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> himselfe following with the body of his Army: <hi>Ʋladislaus,</hi> with great <hi>Huniades</hi> that famous <note place="margin">Huniades.</note> Captaine, prepared an Army of fiue and thirtie thousand men to encounter him: the Bassa encamped by the river of <hi>Monavia, Huniades</hi> not enduring this bravado, with ten thousand men leaving the King in his Camp, passed the river to encounter with the barbarians, who contemning his small number, began the fight: <hi>Castriot</hi> (seeing an opportunity to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish what he had before determined) in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the battel, with his bands began to retreat, and afterwards fled, thereby striking a fear into the other Turks, who soone fled also: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having before imparted his purpose to his friends, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy.</note> to his nephew <hi>Amase,</hi> as they fled through a wood, he laid hands upon the Turks Secretary, and caused him with threatenings to write letters in the name of <hi>Amurath</hi> to the Governour of <hi>Croia</hi> (the regall City of <hi>Epyrus)</hi> to deliver up his command into
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:117874:65"/> the hands of <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> as deputed by him to have the command thereof, and then killing the Secretary, he posted by very long journies into the upper <hi>Dibriae,</hi> where sending for some of the principall men of the towne, he discovered himselfe and purposes to them, who vnanimously assented to what he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, presenting to him their estates &amp; lives, for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him in his Kingdom, and so taking good order for all his affaires, he hastened towards <hi>Croia,</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Amase</hi> before to carry news to the Governour, and to certifie him that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> with his traine was not farr behind: he tooke with him his friends, and a select number of <hi>Dibrians,</hi> and so entring into <hi>Croia,</hi> he delivered the packet, which being opened <note place="margin">He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes master of Croia.</note> and read was easily believed, and the Governour prepared to depart: the night after his men at Armes, which he had left secretly neere the towne, were let in, with whom many of the Citizens joined, who setting first upon the watch, and then on the Garison, put most of them to the sword, and so having made himselfe master of <hi>Croia,</hi> he presently sent to <hi>Dibria</hi> to giue his friends notice of his successe, &amp; to stir up that countrey, and their allies to lay hold upon the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the recoverie of their liberty: he also gaue notice to all the countrey about <hi>Croia,</hi> stirring them up to take armes to free themselves from the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish yoake, who readily and with much joy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and came so flocking in, that he quickly had a good troop of resolute and couragious souldiers, with whom he presently marched to <hi>Dibria,</hi> where <hi>Amase</hi> also had raised an other company: Then he appointed two thousand men to guard the frontiers,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117874:66"/> and with the rest he went into base <hi>Dibria,</hi> where a noble and braue Captaine <hi>[Moses Galome]</hi> came to <note place="margin">Moses Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome.</note> him, that afterwards did him excellent service. In the meane while many of the Turks in those parts <note place="margin">His first vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turkes.</note> assembled together to fight with him, but were easily vanquished, and most of them put to the sword. Then <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> imploying his Captaines to raise all the forces they could; and many Noble men of his kindred, with their followers coming to him, he quickly had an Army of twelue thousand souldiers well appointed, with these he marched to <hi>Petrella</hi> a strong Garison of the Turks, scituate upon the top of a steep rockie mountaine: and partly with faire words, partly with terrible threats, he so farr wrought upon the Governour, that he surrendred <note place="margin">Petrella taken.</note> the place to him, and with his garison departed out of it: From thence having Garisoned the place, he marched (though in the frost and snow) to <note place="margin">Petra-alba taken.</note>
                        <hi>Petra▪alba,</hi> scituated upon the top of a mountaine also, as were all the Cities of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> there the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour was content upon the same termes to quitt the place; and from thence <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> went to <hi>Stellusa,</hi> to which he profered the same termes as he <note place="margin">Stellusa taken.</note> gave to the other; the souldiers were willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of them, but the Governour opposed, but at last they laid hold on him, and delivered him bound to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and so departed: upon this newes all the weaker Garisons easily yielded to him: then he went to <hi>Sfetigrade,</hi> where he attempted to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <note place="margin">Sfetigrade besiged.</note> by a treaty, but the Garison standing out stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against him, and the depth of winter being come, he left <hi>Moses</hi> with three thousand horse to block it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:117874:66"/> up, and to have an eie to the frontiers, and so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to <hi>Croia,</hi> where he disbanded his Army, till there was further occasion. Then he betook himselfe to the service of God, and setling of his civill affairs; but presently came newes from <hi>Moses,</hi> that many of the Turkes were gathered together neere unto him. Whereupon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> taking his followers, and an hundred horse, went straight thither, which the Turks hearing of, presently scattered; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> then took a thousand Horse, that were with <hi>Moses,</hi> and made <note place="margin">He plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.</note> an in-rode into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> spoiling all the Countrey, and returned loaden with the prey.</p>
                     <p>By this time <hi>Amurath</hi> heard of his escape, and of all that he had done in <hi>Epyrus,</hi> which exceedingly grieved and vexed him: Whereupon, calling a Councell, he made peace with the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and bent all his thoughts against <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> assembles a Parliament of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of <hi>Epyrus</hi> at <hi>Lissa,</hi> where he was chosen General of their Forces. The Spring coming on, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> levied his Forces, and took the Field with six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, and so marched to <hi>Sfetigrade:</hi> but the Garrison continuing obstinate, he spoyled the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that they might have no provision; and then with his Army he marched into <hi>Mocrea,</hi> a pleasant and fruitfull Countrey, which he quickly subdued, <note place="margin">Mocrea won.</note> and added it unto his Dominions. This further incensing <hi>Amurath,</hi> he commanded a puissant Army to be levied, which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hearing of by his friends at Court, he strengthened himselfe by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating with his neighbours: And in the mean time <hi>Sfetigrade</hi> was surrendred to <hi>Moses. Amurath</hi> having <note place="margin">Sfetigrade taken.</note>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:117874:67"/> raised an army of forty thousand choyce Horse, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to the leading of <hi>Hali-bassa,</hi> one of his most valiant &amp; experienced Captains: with the report whereof, the common people of <hi>Epyrus</hi> were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted, betaking themselves to prayer for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from so imminent a danger: many also flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to serve under him, out of whom he chose eight thousand Horse, and seven thousand foot, and dismissed the rest. With this Army, after prayers made to God, he went into the lower <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria,</hi> where he heard daily of the approach of his Enemies: Hereupon he caused <hi>Gree Musach</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mase,</hi> with three thousand Horse, to lie in <hi>Ambuscado;</hi> which was no sooner done, but the Turks began to approach, pitching their Camp neer to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> yet knew not that he was so nigh them. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having appointed good watch, bade the rest of his men to betake themselves to their rest. The Turkes having discovered him, grew very insolent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neer the Christians Camp, began to revile them, and challenge them to the battel: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> made his men to be quiet till the rising of the Moone, then he caused them to refresh themselves with food, and so some of them to issue forth to skirmish with the Turkes, in the mean time he ordered his battel: <hi>Hali-Bassa,</hi> contemning the small number of his enemies, gave the first charge with a small Troop of Horse, who after they had charged, retired, hoping that the Christians with eager pursuit, would disorder their battell: But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> finding their policy, kept his men in good order. So both Armies coming on, the Wings began the battell afresh; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> bringing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117874:67"/> on the main battell in the face of the Bassa, valiantly charged him. No sooner were the battels throughly joyned, but the Ambuscado brake out, and charged the Rereward of the Turkes, making such a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that some of them began to flye. Thus was the Bassa's great Army distressed by a few. But he having placed his best Souldiers neerest to himselfe, with them renewed the fight, so that <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> fortune was at a stand, till <hi>Ʋranacontes</hi> coming on with some fresh Troopes from the Rere, brake through the <note place="margin">

                     <p>About this time the Popes Legat perswaded the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> to break his League lately made with <hi>Amurath,</hi> saying, That <hi>Faith was not to be kept with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and Miscreants,</hi> and he absolved the King and <note place="margin">Popish perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> his Nobles from their Oath to the great Turk: and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:117874:68"/> thereupon great preparations were made, and a great Army raised, whereof <hi>Huniades</hi> was made the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Generall. The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> also wrote to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> to come and joyne his Forces with them: which <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> after a Councel held with his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, assented unto, and raising a potent Army, and seeking to God by prayer, for a prosperous journey, he marched towards <hi>Hungary:</hi> But God intending to chastise the perjury of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> from having any hand in so horrid a sinne, stirred up the Despot of <hi>Misia</hi> (a very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest) to deny him passage through his Countrey: Whereupon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> resolved to force it, though it was like to prove a difficult work; and indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could doe it, the Turkes and <hi>Hungarians</hi> had fought a dreadfull battell, wherein many were slain, and amongst others, <hi>Ʋladislaus</hi> with his perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Nobles, and the Christian Army, was wholly <note place="margin">Perjury punished by God.</note> overthrowne.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Amurath</hi> hearing of the spoile that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had made in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> resolved in the next place to take him to task; but first he sought to undermine him by treachery, and offers of peace and amity, writing to him for that purpose. But <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his wiles, wrote back to him, rejecting his proffered peace. <hi>Amurath</hi> was much incensed at this, and hearing that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had dismissed his Army, and kept the Field onely with his Horse, who also ranged up and down carelesly after prey, he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117874:68"/> sent for <hi>Feresey</hi> Bassa, a Captain of a fierce and ready spirit, and loading him with promises, if he returned Victor, he gave him nine thousand Horse, all chosen and pickt men, commanding him speedily and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to enter into <hi>Epyrus,</hi> before the enemy were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: who accordingly proceeded, and promised to himselfe victory before he came thither. But all this was not concealed from <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> who sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went and seized on a narrow valley called <hi>Mocrea,</hi> which the Turkes of necessity must passe through; where, hiding his men in Woods and Rockes, till the Turkes were intangled on all sides, they then vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently brake out upon them, killing and slaying of <note place="margin">Feresey Bassa o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verthrown</note> them at their pleasure. The Turkes made stout resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but their Horses in that place rather hindred then holp them, so that the greatest number of them were slaine, and the rest throwing away their Armes, upon their knees craved mercy, and had it, and so were made prisoners.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Feresey</hi> almost in the beginning of the fight, seeing his men enclosed and slaughtered, and not knowing his enemies number, turned back with those troopes that were about him, and so escaped, yet was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued by the Christians, and lost many in his flight. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath,</hi> when he heard of it, was marvellously trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and perplexed, bending all his thoughts against <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and therefore presently sent <hi>Mustapha,</hi> a Politick and hardy Captain, with a new supply of six thousand souldiers to take <hi>Feresey's</hi> charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him in no case to enter farr into <hi>Epyrus,</hi> but to burne and spoile the frontiers of it: who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly coming into the Valley of <hi>Mocrea,</hi> pitched
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117874:69"/> his Camp upon the side of an hill, placed his scouts upon the tops of the mountaines, kept foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse with himselfe in his Camp, and sent nine thousand abroad to spoile the countrey: <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> drawing neere to the valley with foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, and one thousand foot, was informed of all these passages, and seeing that Policy was not to be used against so wary an enemy, he resolved to assault him suddenly in his trenches, before his dispersed Troops could retire to him: and so entring the valley, he was presently discovered, and warning given to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> who endeavoured to call back his men, and some that were neere, hasted to him: <note place="margin">Mustapha Bassa o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</note>
                        <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> souldiers followed them at the heels, and assaulted them in their trenches, beat them from them, and fell pell mell upon them, filling all their Camp with feare, and slaughter: <hi>Mustapha</hi> seeing that all was like to be lost, escaped at the port which was furthest from the enemy, some of his men also following of him: fiue thousand Turks were slaine, three hundred taken, and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> lost but twentie horsemen, and fiftie footmen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mustapha</hi> afterwards obtained an other great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Amurath,</hi> with which he went against <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derberg,</hi> who lying at the siege of <hi>Dayna</hi> against the <hi>Ʋenetians,</hi> had present information sent him from his garisons upon the frontiers of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> whom he commanded by a speedy messenger in no wise to encounter with the enemy, but to keep themselves in their strong holds till his coming, and so leaving <hi>Amase</hi> to continue the siege, he tooke fiue hundred horse, and a thousand fiue hundred footmen, with
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117874:69"/> which he hasted to the reliefe of his garisons: <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> had sought by all meanes to draw forth <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbegs</hi> men out of their holds, but seeing that they would not stirr, he began to burne and spoile all the countrey, till hearing of <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> approach, he called all his Army together and incamped within two miles of him: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> drawing some forces out of his garison, had in all foure thousand horse, &amp; two thousand foot, with which having strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his trenches, he left three hundred for the guard of them, and issuing forth with the rest, he placed them in order of Battell. <hi>Mustapha</hi> did the like; but before the battell began, there came from the Turks a man at Arms in rich and gallant furniture, challenging any one of the Christians to fight hand to hand with him: <hi>Paul Manessi</hi> thereupon stepped to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> desiring leave that he might accept the challenge, and chastise the proud Turk, which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> assenting to, and praying for his successe, he presently mounted on horsback, rode forth to the Turke, bidding him to prepare himselfe to the battell: both Generalls agreed upon the Lawes for the combat, and so the champions taking their course, ran each at other with their speares, and <hi>Menassi</hi> ran the Turk through the head, and so slew him, and then alighting, he stroke off his head, tooke his Armour, and returned to the Camp loaden with <note place="margin">A Duell fought, and the Turke slaine Mustapha beaten a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaine and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</note> his spoiles. <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> men were much encouraged with this good <hi>Omen,</hi> and the Turks as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, whereupon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> presently marched forward against them, and charged the Turks with such fury, that they presently began to retire: <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:117874:70"/> seeing that, put spurs to his horse, resolving to win the field or die; most of his chiefe captaines did the like, which a little renued the battell; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <hi>Mustapha</hi> and twelue of his chiefe men were taken prisoners, the rest slaine and scattered: there were killed of the Turks ten thousand men, and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ensignes taken: the Christians lost but three hundred; they found a rich prey in the Turks Camp: yet did <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> make an inrode into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> spoiled and tooke a great booty, then left two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse, and one thousand foot for the guard of his frontiers, and so returned to the siege of <hi>Dayna.</hi>

                     <p>Shortly after the <hi>Venetians</hi> made peace with <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and <hi>Amurath</hi> sent him rich presents, with fiue and twentie thousand Duckats to redeeme his Captaines, whom <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had used honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and sent them away with a safe convoy, the money he divided amongst his souldiers: and then he made an other inrode into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Army into three parts, he laid all wast, and brought away a rich prey, that he might leaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the reliefe of his enemies, when they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe: <hi>Amurath</hi> was so incensed herewith, that he resolved to send no more of his Captaines, but to goe in his owne person with such an host, that should fill every corner of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and make an easy conquest of it: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> either having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or suspecting the worst, when he heard of such great preparations, advertised his Christian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to stand upon their guard, and mustered up all his men, took up all the provisions through <hi>Epy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> where with he stored his Garisons, and thrust

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:117874:74"/> to their great joy and comfort: then <hi>Amurath</hi> caused the assault to be renewed with more fury, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it till almost night, in which he lost eight thousand men, without any considerable damage to the garison, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> hearing where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was encamped, tooke all the best souldiers in the Camp, and lodged in that quarter which was next him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at his next assault thereby to entrap him: which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> being by fugitiues informed of, appointed <hi>Moses</hi> the night following with fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horse to alarum that quarter, and then to retire to his campe, whilst himselfe with the rest of his men, going through by-waies, brake in on the other side of the Turks Army, where he made such havock amongst them, that their losse in the storme was forgotten in comparison of this: and then fearing to be oppressed with multitude, he retired to his Camp. The next morning <hi>Amurath</hi> encouraged his men againe to make a new assault, which they did <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond assault.</note> performe with much fury, and continued it long by fresh supplies, but they were so brauely repulsed by the Christians, that at last he sounded the retreat, grieving much to see so many of his men slaine: His next designe was to undermine the City, and as he was doing of it, a great convoy of victualls coming towards his Camp, <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> having intelligence of it, met the convoy, slew them, and divided the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion amongst his owne souldiers; And having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased his Army with two thousand recruits, he divided it into three parts, giving one to <hi>Moses,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to <hi>Tanusie,</hi> and tooke the third himselfe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing in the dead of the night to assault the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:117874:74"/> Turks Camp in three parts; but himselfe being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the Scouts, whilst all men ran to that side, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Tanusie</hi> brake into two other parts, where they slue a number of the Turkes, and made great spoile. In the mean time <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> retreated, and sate down on the side of a Hill, in the sight of the Turkes Army; which they taking as a bravado, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested leave of <hi>Amurath</hi> to goe against him, and accordingly they issued out seven thousand Horse, and five thousand foot of their best Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> seeing their approach, retreated soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, waiting for <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Tanusi's</hi> coming to him: The Turkes followed with much difficulty, till per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the other Forces coming, they began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; <note place="margin">The Turkes beaten.</note> whereupon <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> charged them with much fury, and slue many of them. <hi>Moses</hi> also came upon them, killing some, and taking many priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in sight of the Turkes Camp, and so retreated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the mountaines. All <hi>Amuraths</hi> hopes fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he sent a Bassa to the Governour of <hi>Croia,</hi> to try, if by large and glorious promises he could win him to surrender the Citie. But <hi>Ʋranocontes</hi> scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the presents which he brought, and the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <note place="margin">Fidelity.</note> that he made, charged him, that neither he nor any other should presume to come to him any more; but if they did, he would cut off their hands, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and eares, and so return them to their master.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon <hi>Amurath,</hi> in a great rage, commanded all things to be prepared for a new storm, which the next day he put in execution, but to his owne great losse, the Christians valiantly defending themselves against the Turkes fury: This put him almost out <note place="margin">The third assault.</note>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:117874:75"/> of his wits, that he pulled off his haire; and though his Bassa's endeavoured to comfort him, yet hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">Pride.</note> sick of griefe, that a small town should eclypse all his former glory; and finding that his end ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, he called his Sonne, and great Captaines, <note place="margin">Malice. <hi>Amurath</hi> dieth.</note> charging them not to leave his death unrevenged: and so shortly after he gave up the ghost.</p>
                     <p>After whose death <hi>Mahomet</hi> presently raised the siege, and returned to <hi>Hadrianople;</hi> yet shortly after sent Embassadors to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> proffering peace, if he would pay him a certain tribute: Which motion <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> scornfuly rejected, and so dismissed the Embassadours, and presently after hee made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode into the Turkish Dominions, which he grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously wasted, and returned home loaden with spoil. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> to requite him, sent <hi>Amesa,</hi> one of his best Captaines, with twelve thousand Horsemen, to doe the like in <hi>Epyrus:</hi> which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by his Espials, he lay close in ambush with six thousand Souldiers upon the great mountain <hi>Modris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> over which the Turkes were to passe; who, with much difficulty, having almost got to the top thereof in the night, were suddenly charged by <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Footmen, who made a great slaughter of them, their <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Amesa</hi> Bassa bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> Horses being rather an hindrance than an help to them, so that they were driven down the mountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; &amp; when they came to the foot of it, they were again charged by <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and <hi>Amesa,</hi> who with their Horsemen were set in places of advantage: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were totally routed, seven thousand slain, and <hi>Amesa,</hi> with most of the best Captains, taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, with whom he returned with great joy to <hi>Croia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">And taken prisoner.</note>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:117874:75"/> using his prisoners very courteously. <hi>Amesa</hi> desired of him, that he might send to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to informe him of their state, which he assented unto, and set their ransom at thirteen thousand Duckets. <hi>Mahomet</hi> stormed extreamly at this disaster, and refused to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some the prisoners; yet afterwards, by the perswasion of his Bassa's, he sent it, with other rich presents, to <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> Whereupon he sent them back with a safe Convoy, and divided the money amongst his <note place="margin">Bounty.</note> Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>The proud Tyrant resolved revenge, and therefore sent <hi>Debreas,</hi> one of his best Captaines, loaden with promises of great preferment, if he prevailed against <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> and under him fourteen thousand choyce Horsemen, which were as many as <hi>Debreas</hi> desired, and with which he promised to chastise <hi>Scanderbeg. Scanderbeg</hi> having intelligence hereof, resolved not to stay his coming into <hi>Epyrus,</hi> but to meet him by the way: And so taking six thousand horsemen, he went into the enemies countrey, and came by night into a great plain, where the Turkes lay, hoping not to have been discovered; but the Moon shining bright, the Scouts had discovered him, and gave the Alarm to their Camp, and <hi>Debreas</hi> mindfull of his promise to his Lord, sent out some Troops to skirmish with him, whiles he set the rest of his Army in order: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> sent out some to encounter them; and ere long both Armies charged each other with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: And <hi>Debreas</hi> did so encourage his men, and <note place="margin">A terrible fight.</note> fought so valiantly, that <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Fortune seemed to be at a stand▪ Thus both sides did their uttermost to conquer, one while one party prevailing, and then
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:117874:76"/> the other, till at last <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> encountred hand to hand with <hi>Debreas,</hi> and slew him, with whose fall <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Debreas</hi> Bassa slain and his at my routed.</note> the whole Army was discouraged and fled, whom the Christians eagerly pursuing, slue more in the chase then in the battell; for of the Turkes were slain four thousand one hundred and twenty; but of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians very few. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> returned thanks to God <note place="margin">Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</note> for that great and doubtfull victory, dividing the spoyle and prisoners amongst his Souldiers, and so returned with great joy to <hi>Croia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the report of this defeat <hi>Mahomet</hi> grew very melancholy; whereupon his great Bassa's offered to spend their lives in that service: But the crafty Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant intended to go another way to work, <hi>viz.</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt some of <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> chief Commanders, which would easiliest turn to his ruine. And amongst others singling out <hi>Moses Galome,</hi> which was counted the best Captain next to <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> himselfe, hee found <note place="margin">Treachery</note> means secretly to send to him, proffering him store of gold, and promising golden Mountaines, honours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout himself, yea the Kingdom of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> if he desired it. <hi>Moses</hi> was at last prevailed with, yet presently left not <hi>Epyrus,</hi> but perswaded <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> to besiege <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi> in the confines of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> which was held by the Turkes, giving him hopes of an easie conquest. <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> deceived by him, made all things ready for <note place="margin">Belgrade besieged.</note> the siege, and sent to <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> his speciall friend, for some men that were versed in managing of Sieges; which he obtained from him, and so sate downe before <hi>Belgrade,</hi> with an Army of fourteen thousand brave men, and in a short time so distressed the Citie, that the Turkes desired truce for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:117874:76"/> sixteen dayes, promising that if reliefe came not in that space, they would surrender the Citie to him. This <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> consented to, &amp; so himself encamped on an high Hill with three thousand Horse, and one thousand Foot, and sent <hi>Musachius</hi> and <hi>Tanusius</hi> with the rest of his Army, into a great plain, where they might lie freelier in that hot season, and withall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed five and twenty Scouts to keep continuall watch towards the enemies Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> hearing of this siege, presently dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sebalias</hi> Bassa sent. to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of Belgrade.</note> away <hi>Sebalias,</hi> a great Captaine, with fortie thousand horse to relieve <hi>Belgrade,</hi> promising him great rewards if he could bring him <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, or dead. This Bassa by long journeies prevented the fame of his coming, and drawing neere to <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbegs</hi> Campe, he intrapped, or corrupted his scouts, so that they gaue noe warning of the Turks approach: yea he came so suddenly on that part of the army which lay in the plaine, that they had not leysure to bridle their horses, or put on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: <hi>Musachius</hi> arming himselfe, endeavoured to order his men, seeing equall danger in fight, and flight, and therefore resolved to sell his life as deare as he could, but seeing his men slaine by heapes about him, he endeavoured to have broken through, and escaped to the mountaines to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> but being oppressed with multitude, he continued fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the astonishment of his enemies, till he and <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> from the mountaine saw this miserable slaughter of his men, and would with his handfull of souldiers have gone downe to their rescue, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, but was with-held by his Captaines, who told him, that he would thereby expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and them to certaine destruction: <hi>Sebalias</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the pursuit of <hi>Tanusius</hi> and his party, with most of his Army, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> came downe <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> slew many of the Turks.</note> suddenly upon the rest, and slew them in an instant, and then followed at the taile of the Turks, did them much mischief, till <hi>Sebalias</hi> gathering all his forces together, made head against him, yet <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> againe charged them, and slew with his owne hand two braue Champions which had before sworne to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to kill him if they met with him. The fight continued till the night parted them, and then both Armies retreated, <hi>Sebalias</hi> to <hi>Belgrade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> towards <hi>Epyrus,</hi> whither he marched the next day, leaving good guards upon all the streight passes, lest the Turks should break into <hi>Epyrus:</hi> of <hi>Scandrebegs</hi> men were slaine fiue thousand, but most of them the <hi>Italians</hi> that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus</hi> had sent him, and the Turks lost three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: <hi>Sebalias</hi> repaired the battered walls of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> reinforced the Garison, and then returned <note place="margin">Belgrade relieved.</note> with great triumph to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> being the first Captaine that ever gaue a defeat to <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi> and he was received there with such applause, as if he had conquered a great Kingdome, everie man talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the praises of <hi>Sebalias:</hi> and noe preferment was thought too great, or reward sufficient for him: The poore Christian captiues taken by him, were

                     <p>Moses hearing of this losse, thought it a fit time for him to revolt in, and so went to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where, by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> he was joyfully received, and honorably entertained; <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> hearing of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, was at first much astonished, but after a while <note place="margin">Moses turnes traitour</note> he said no more, but that he wished that all treason was together with <hi>Moses</hi> gon out of <hi>Epyrus: Moses</hi> much solicited <hi>Mahomet</hi> to continue his warrs with <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> promising to doe great matters therein: yet the crafty Tyrant durst not at first trust him too farr, till in time he had discovered that his affections were wholly alienated from <hi>Scanderbeg:</hi>

The Turks could not believe that <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> was so nigh them on that side: but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> following at his heeles with his Horse, and his foot hasting after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to break in upon them; and the other parts of his Army descending from the Mountaine with such horrible shouts and noise of instruments of warre, as <note place="margin">A great battell.</note> if Heaven and Earth should presently goe together; the Hills and Vallies with their hollow eccho en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the terror of the Alarm. <hi>Amase</hi> first made head, and encouraged the Turkes; with whom <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> encountred, and whilst the Bassa was coming to his rescue, <hi>Moses</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Tanusius</hi> on <note place="margin">The Turks beaten.</note> the other, charged him so hotly, that he was glad to retire to his Trenches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amase</hi> still with great courage withstood his Uncle, and encouraged his Turkes: yet <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing on them, they at last turned their backes and fled: <hi>Scanderbegs</hi> Horse pursuing the chase, slue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many, and took <hi>Amase</hi> prisoner. <hi>Moses</hi> also had dispersed the Bassa's Army, and pursued them till they were out of <hi>Epyrus:</hi> many were slain, and many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoners, and twenty of the Turkes fairest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, of whom were slain about twenty thousand, &amp; of the Christians about sixty. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> possessed the rich pavillion of the Bassa; and his Captains had Tents with much rich furniture, never prepared for their use.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:117874:80"/>
                     <p> And so with his victorious Army he marched to <hi>Croia,</hi> all the countrey coming forth to meet him with acclamations of joy. <hi>Amase</hi> was condemned to perpetuall imprisonment, and sent to <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> with part of the spoyle, by him to be kept in durance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> was much grieved for this losse, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the Bassa; yet afterwards was pacified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. After which he concluded a peace with <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A peace concluded</note> for a year: and when that was expired, he sent an Army under <hi>Synan-beg</hi> of twenty thousand into <hi>Epyrus,</hi> with which <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> forthwith encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> finding that he could not prevail by force, betook himselfe to craft, writing kinde Letters to <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> by his Embassadors, concluded a peace <note place="margin">A peace made.</note> with him, which was proclaimed with great joy, and faithfully kept for a season, whilst <hi>Mahomet</hi> made warre with the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but there being provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of both sides by the Borderers, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with an Army into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> made much spoil, and returned with a great Booty.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having intelligence hereof, marched thither with twelve thousand, lying in ambush neere the Citie where the Turkes were; and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he sent five hundred towards the Enemy, to draw him out, if they could, into the Field: But if he came forth, to retreat to the place where the Army <note place="margin">

Then <hi>Mahomet</hi> sent <hi>Balabanus</hi> with fifteene thousand horse, and three thousand foot to invade <hi>Epyrus,</hi> who knowing that <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg</hi> lay not farr from him with a small power, he intended in the night to set upon him at unawars, but <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> having intelligence by his scouts, set forward in good order to meet him. <hi>Balabanus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that he was discovered, made an <hi>Alt: Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> when he drew nigh him, considering the ground where the enemie lay, encouraged his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which were but foure thousand horse, and a thousand fiue hundred foot, charged them on their lives, that if the enemie in the fight retired, they should not pursue them beyond the streites of the hill, suspecting an Ambush behind it: and so retired a little, which <hi>Balabanus,</hi> seeing his small number, judged to be a flight, and therefore hastily marched <note place="margin">A great Battell.</note> after, till <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> watching his opportunity stayed, and set couragiously upon them, yet the battell a great while stood doubtfull, but such was the fury of <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> and his souldiers, that at last the Turks fled, and they pursued to the streits of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, where <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had commanded them to stay.

                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> was extreame angry with him, but when his fury was over, <hi>Balabanus</hi> told him, that the way to conquer <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> was to enter <hi>Epyrus</hi> with two puissant Armies, to spoile the countrey, and enclose <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> betwixt them, and neither to fight, but when the other was neere at hand, by which meanes he might certainly be destroyed: the Tyrant liked this advise so well, that he gave him commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take what forces he would, and to choose his associate out of all his men of warr &amp;c. <hi>Balabanus</hi> chose out fortie thousand good souldiers, and one <hi>Iacup,</hi> a valiant Captaine, for his companion, whom he sent with sixteene thousand one way, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with twentie thousand horse and foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foote went an other way: <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> having secret intelligence of all these projects, gat in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse eight thousand horse, and foure thousand foot, choise souldiers, and sent out his Espialls: who hoping for great rewards, proved false tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and went to <hi>Balabanus,</hi> acquainting him with <note place="margin">

To which they made no answer but with the mouth of the Cannon: <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> also continually molested his Camp, and brake into their Quarters every night. Whereupon <hi>Mahomet</hi> rose with his Army, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of many <hi>Epyrots,</hi> retired into the mountaines; <note place="margin">The siege raised.</note> he went to seek them out, but was by them repulsed with great losse. <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> also following him at the heeles, daily cut off part of his Army: So that at last the Tyrant despairing to doe any good, went back with vexation and shame to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After all this, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> viewed the state of his kingdome, ordered his affaires, and then went to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:117874:85"/>
                        <hi>Lyssa,</hi> to conferre with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Embassadour and the other confederate Princes: But within few dayes he fell sick of a Feaver, and perceiving his end to draw nigh, he sent for his Wife, and Sonne, and the confederate Princes, discoursed to them of his troublesome life, fore-warned them of the dangers that were like to ensue, perswaded them to persevere in unity, made the <hi>Venetians</hi> protectors of his Son and Kingdome: And so after he had with most fervent prayer commended his soule into the hands of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, hee quietly left this life, <hi>January</hi> 17. <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1466. and of his age sixty three, of his <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs</hi> death</note> reigne twenty foure.</p>
                     <p>His death was much lamented by all Christian Princes, especially his neighbours, who had lost their most carefull Watchman, and invincible Champion. The sorrow of his subjects is not to be expressed: He was royally buried in the Cathedrall in <hi>Lyssa.</hi> Yet nine yeares after the Turkes having taken the City, with great devotion digged up his bones, reckoning it some part of their happinesse, if they might see or touch the same: such as could get any part thereof, set it in silver or gold, and hung it about their necks, <note place="margin">His bones digged up by the Turkes.</note> perswading themselves, that it would make them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and prosperous.</p>
                     <p>He was a man of rare parts, and of an indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> spirit: During all the time of his warres he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver slept above two houres in a night: He ever fought against the Turkes with his Arm bare, and that with such fiercenesse, that the blood did oft-times burst out of his lips. He with his owne hands in those wars slue at least three thousand of the <hi>Turks.</hi> What his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117874:85"/> strength was, may appeare by these examples. There was in a part of <hi>Epyrus</hi> a mighty wilde Bull, that had murthered many, &amp; committed a thousand outrages: him <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> encountred with on Horseback, and with one onely blow of his Cimitar, he cut his neck clean from his shoulders.</p>
                     <p>Also a monstrous Boare in <hi>Apulia,</hi> that had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many of King <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Courtiers, <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg</hi> being hunting with the King, encountred with this Beast, and soon parted his head from his body.</p>
                     <p>His Cimitar was made at <hi>Damasco</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and was of an excellent temper: he oft carried two of them in one Scabbard, and sometimes would break them both in one battell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet</hi> hearing that he would cut Helmets, Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces and Pouldrons clean asunder with it, he sent to him for one of his Swords, thinking that there had been some extraordinary vertue in them: And when <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> had sent it, he put it into their hands, who had the strongest Arms about him; but perceiving no such wonders as was reported of it, he sent it back with scorn, saying, That <hi>he would not be beholding to him for that which he could get for his money:</hi> and that <hi>he credited not what was related to him of that sword.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>Scanderbeg,</hi> in the sight of the Messenger, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made strange and admirable proofes of it, bade him tell his Master, that it was not the vertue of the Sword, but the strength of his Arme, which hee reserved against his enemies.</p>
                     <p>God raised up this worthy Christian Prince, and endowed him with such excellent parts, as another

To breake the blow, some putting up their hands, had their fingers cut off: the <hi>Hungarians</hi> without, hearing the tumult, brake into the chamber, where they presently slew this false Earle <hi>Vlrick,</hi> and cut him almost all to piees: the King was much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented hereat in his minde, yet seeing there was no other remedy, he dissembled his griefe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and making faire weather to <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> he tooke him along with him towards <hi>Buda:</hi> By the way, passing by the Towne where <hi>Huniades</hi> wife was, <note place="margin">Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> mourning for the death of her husband, the King went to her and seemed with many faire words to comfort her, there he rested, and refreshed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and so departed with much dissembled loue, and fained favour, and tooke along with him the two sonnes of <hi>Huniades, Ladislaus</hi> and <hi>Matthias,</hi> who where now without suspition, and therefore the more ready to waite upon him: But when he came to <hi>Buda,</hi> he caused them both to be suddenly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; and immediately after the elder <hi>[Ladislaus]</hi> was brought forth to the place of execution: at

                     <p>
                        <hi>Matthias</hi> having well considered of this their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, answered, That they had many times before in the like case, refused to give aid to the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Kings his predecessors; yea, and judged it a thing unreasonable, that any such thing should be reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted at their hands: So that the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Kings had many times received great losse for want of their assistance: Yet he was willing to forget all such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse, and to take their Territories into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, according to their request; promising with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the next Spring to invade the Turkes Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And according to his promise hee honorably performed it: For in the beginning of the Spring he passed over the <hi>Danubius</hi> at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> with a puissant <note place="margin">His wars against the Turkes.</note> Army, and razed the Forts which the Turkes had built thereabouts, and so entring into <hi>Servia,</hi> laid all the Countrey wast before him; and afterwards la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with spoyle, returned home again, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him twenty thousand captives. And with the like prosperous successe he maintained warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, and against his sonne <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet,</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:117874:89"/> almost alwayes going away with the victory; so that there was no Christian King or Chieftaine, that did ever more often with successe fight against the Turkes, or had of them greater victories.</p>
                     <p>Then did he (according to his promise made to the <hi>Venetians)</hi> enter into the Kingdome of <hi>Bosna;</hi> where, by force, he overthrew the strong Forts which the Turk had built for the defence of the Frontiers, and valiantly drave them all out before him, till he came to <hi>Jaitze,</hi> the chiefe Citie of <hi>Bosna,</hi> unto which he <note place="margin">

                     <p>This so vexed the proud <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that in great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he came with a mighty Army into <hi>Bosna,</hi> and laid hard siege unto <hi>Jaitze,</hi> which was by the Christians worthily defended, till <hi>Matthias</hi> came to the reliefe thereof, who so troubled the Turks Camp with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall skirmishes on the one side; and they within <note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Matthias</hi> having thus valiantly relieved the City, followed the Turkes Army into <hi>Servia,</hi> and tooke part of that Countrey also; which, together with <note place="margin">Part of <hi>Servia</hi> taken.</note>
                        <hi>Bosna,</hi> he annexed to the Kingdome of <hi>Hungary:</hi> So that now the name of <hi>Matthias</hi> was unto the Turks, no lesse dreadfull, then was sometimes the name of his valiant Father <hi>Huniades.</hi>

                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:117874:92"/> disposed to learning, that he seemed rather borne so, then instructed in it; he was full of Clemency, courage, care and knowledg in state affaires. He was very tender of shedding blood, so that none were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in his time for religion, but only two blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Hereticks, <hi>Ioan Butcher,</hi> and <hi>Georg,</hi> a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>

He was exceeding skilfull in fortifications: He knew all the principall ports of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland</hi>

He was exceeding carefull about State affairs, was much with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and would well understand what matters passed them, and upon what grounds: and would often encounter their reasons, and give lively reasons of his owne, insomuch that they made an order, that no matters of weight should be debated, but when he was present: He had a Chest, where of himselfe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Key, wherein he kept record, of such matters as were concluded by his Councell: He set time apart to dispatch poore mens causes without tedious attendance, &amp; delay. Of all the Magistrates, Iustices &amp; Gentlemen of quality in his realme, he knew their

To Ambassadours he would giue answer upon the sudden, and touch both orderly, and fully upon everie part of their speech, to the admiration of his hearers: He much frequented Sermons, and penned <note place="margin">His Piety.</note> them with his owne hands: His sports were inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, and manlike, whereby he alwaies learned something: He in the middest of all his businesses reserved daily some houres for his private studies and exercises with his teachers.</p>
                     <p>About this time preparations were made for warr with <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was thus occasioned: <hi>Mary</hi>

                        <hi>Stuart</hi> sole daughter and heir to <hi>Iames</hi> the fifth, being very young, was desired by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to to be assured to his sonne Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> which was assented to by the Nobility, and Parliament of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and all conditions, and covenants were concluded, sealed, and sworne to of both parties, and a peace established for ten yeares, at the end whereof both Prince and Queene should be of age to consent.

                        <hi>Scotland,</hi> and sent a great Fleet by Sea to meet him there. In the Army were twelve thousand Foot, &amp; two thousand eight hundred light Horse: The Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> was Lieutenant Generall, the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Wilton</hi> was Marshall of the Field, &amp;c. The Protector of <hi>Scotland</hi> also made great preparation to resist them, Making his Rendevouz at <hi>Musklebrough</hi> Field, whither the <hi>English</hi> marched; and so between the two nations, a great and cruell battell was fought, <note place="margin">A great battell.</note> wherein the English were victors, and pursued the <hi>Scots</hi> for five hours space, doing great execution upon <note place="margin">The Scors beaten.</note> them, so that the river of <hi>Esk</hi> ran red with blood.</p>
                     <p>Divers of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nobility and Gentry were slain, and of the inferior sort about ten thousand. Of the <hi>English</hi> were slain fifty two, but very many hurt. And thus the Lord revenged upon them their perfidiousnesse in breaking their Oathes and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. In the which victory this also is to bee noted, that the same day and houre wherein the Images were <note place="margin">Perjury punished by God.</note> burned openly in <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> received this great overthrow.</p>
                     <p>Also fifteen hundred of the <hi>Scots</hi> were taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, amongst whom was the Earle of <hi>Huntley,</hi> &amp; some other Noble-men: <hi>Huntley</hi> being afterwards asked, how he stood affected to the intended marriage, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>That he liked the marriage well, but he liked</hi>

                     <p>A great alteration also was made in Religion, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions were set forth for removing Images out

                     </p>
                     <p>In the first yeare of the King, a Parliament was held, wherein was enacted, That none should speak against receiving the Sacrament in both kindes, That all Processes Ecclesiasticall should be made in the Kings name: The Statute of the six Articles was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and that which prohibited the use of the Scriptures in <hi>English:</hi> A Liturgy was set forth; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners being sent abroad to pull down Images in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> one of them was stabbed by a Priest, as he <note place="margin">A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner stabbed.</note> was pulling down an Image: and afterwards the whole County rose in a commotion, which spred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so into <hi>Wiltshire</hi> and <hi>Summersetshire;</hi> they beat down <note place="margin">A Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note> Enclosures, and Parks: but Sir <hi>William Herbert,</hi> with some Souldiers, set upon them, slue some, and scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the rest.</p>
                     <p>The like commotions were raised in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which by the prudence of Gentlemen, and other honest persons, were appeased: Yet afterwards there was another rising in the West Countries, to whom the King wrote, First reproving them for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered assemblies; then hee pitied their ignorance, and errors thence arising, perswading them to return to their homes, and due obedience. In which Letter he thus wrote to them, <hi>Assure your selves most surely, that we of no earthly thing under the Heaven, make such</hi>

In the meane time the L.

                     <p>In the mean time the Citizens suffered great want, made bread of the coursest bran: their finest flesh was <note place="margin">A famine in <hi>Exeter.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> coming with more Forces, set upon them, slue above 900. of them, and dispersed the rest: notwithstanding which, about two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand of them r'allying the next day, affronted the Kings Forces, yet after a while, they ran away.

                        <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1550 letters were sent abroad for the taking downe of Altars in Churches and setting up of Tables instead of the same: and during all the time that the Nobles lived in peace amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, religion flourished, the Gospell had a free passage, Popery was confounded, and scarce a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist found that durst shew his head: The popish Doctors, <hi>Smith, Chadsey, Standish, Young, Oglethorp,</hi>

He had also a great faintnesse, which shewed that his vitall parts were most strongly and strangely assaulted. And the common report was, that his sicknesse proceeded from a slow working poyson. His sicknesse was much lamented, not onely by his own people, but by strangers, his courtesie and wisdome having procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him much love every where. He was famous for his fore sight and judgement in affaires; and he so well tempered the greatnesse of his estate with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and gravity, that he avoyded envy by the one, and contempt by the other.</p>
                     <p>In the time of his sicknesse, Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> preaching before him, in his Sermon much commended works of Charity, which as they were a duty for all men to performe, so more especially for those which were in great place, as well in regard of their great abilities, as for that they were obliged to give example thereby unto others.</p>

Thirdly, such as were poore by idlenesse, unthriftinesse, &amp;c. The first, to be educated and maintained: the second to be cured and relieved: the third, to be corrected and reduced to good order: which being presented to the King, he gave to the City, for education and maintenance of the first, the <hi>Gray-Friers</hi> Church by Newgate market, with all the revenewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it: to the second, Saint <hi>Bartholomews</hi> neere <hi>Smithfield:</hi> for the third, his house at <hi>Bridewell:</hi>
                        <pb n="170" facs="tcp:117874:98"/> and for increase of maintenance to these, besides the Hospitall of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> he gave seven hundred &amp; fifty marks yearly out of the rents of the Hospitall of <hi>St. Iohn Baptist,</hi> or the <hi>Savoy,</hi> with all the bedding and furniture belonging to that place: and the charter of this gift being presented to him with a blank for lands in <hi>Mortmaine,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently filled it up with these words, <hi>Foure thousand marks by the yeare:</hi> which being done, with reverend gesture, and Speech, he thanked God for prolonging his life to finish that businesse.

The people did hereupon breake forth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately into passion, complaining that for this <note place="margin">The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, &amp; sorrow.</note> cause his two uncles had beene taken away: for this cause the most faithfull of his Nobility and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had beene disgraced and discarded, and that for this cause such were placed about him as were ready to commit, or permit any mischiefe.</p>
                     <p>Yet at this time the Lord <hi>Guilford,</hi> fourth son to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> was married to the Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> eldest daughter to the Duke of <hi>Summerset,</hi> by <hi>Frances</hi> daughter to <hi>Mary,</hi> second sister to <hi>Henry</hi> the eight: And albeit this Lady <hi>Iane</hi> had noe right to the Crowne, for she was excluded by the Ladies <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by the issue of Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> eldest sister to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, married into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by <hi>Frances,</hi> this Lady <hi>Ianes</hi> mother, now

Thus the Duke, having (as he thought) secured all, nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but to dispatch the King: His disease was violent, yet the Physitians had some hope of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverie, if he might be removed into an healthfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aire: but this the Duke over-auing the Councell, would not suffer: then a Gentlewoman was brought, <note place="margin">Treachery</note> who would undertake to cure him, the Kings Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians talking with her, and finding her extreame ignorant, would not consent that she should med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with him: yet the Duke caused them to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and the cure to be committed to her alone: hereupon she administring something to him, the King fell into desperate extreamities, his vitall parts were mortally stuffed, he breathed with difficulty,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:117874:99"/> his legs swelled, his pulse failed, his skin changed colour, and many other horrid Symptoms appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: then were the Physitians called againe, who seeing how he was, departed with a sad silence: tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their friends, that they were called for fashion sake, but neither their advise, nor remedies used. And that the King had beene ill dealt with more then once: So the King having long wrestled with a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering tormenting sicknesse, about three houres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, his eies being closed, thinking that none heard him, made this Godly prayer; <hi>Lord God, deliver me out of this miserable and wretched life, and</hi>

During all the reigne of her Father King <hi>Henry,</hi> and of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Edward,</hi> she lived in a Princely fashion: But under the reign of her sister Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> she met with so many afflictions, that she well deserved the title of <hi>Elizabeth the Confessor.</hi> Yet those very affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, through Gods goodnesse, did her so much <note place="margin">Benefit of her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> good, that it's hard to say, whether she were more happy in having a Crown so soon, or in having it no sooner, till affliction had first laid in her a low and therfore sure foundation of humility, for Highness to be afterwards built upon. By which means she was so ripened for her future Rule and Soveraignty, that Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth professed, that amongst all the Princes in Christendome, he found but two which were worthy to beare command, if they had not been stained with Heresie, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Queen of <hi>England.</hi> But as in order of time her Sufferings preceded her Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so we will first set them down to the view of the Reader.</p>
                     <p>When Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came first to the Crowne, she <note place="margin">Hypocrisie</note> pretended much love to her sister, the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth:</hi> for before she was crowned, she would goe no whither, but she would have her by the hand, and send for her to dinner and Supper: But after she was crowned, she kept her aloofe from her: and shortly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:117874:101"/> after, upon the rising of Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat,</hi> she with the Lord <hi>Courtney,</hi> were falsly charged to have a hand in it: whereupon the Lady <hi>Marie</hi> sent three of her councellers, with two hundred and fifty horsemen of their retinue to her, then lying at her house at <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> who found her very sick in bed, and very feeble and weak of body: yet they going up to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, willed one of her Ladies to tell her, that they were sent to her with a message from the Queene: Her grace being told of it, said, she was glad of their coming, howbeit being very weak and it now ten a <note place="margin">Incivility of the Lords.</note> clock at night, she requested them to come againe to her the next morning: to which they replyed, that they must needes see her, and would doe it in what case soever she were, and with all hastily rushed into her chamber, whereupon she being not a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, said unto them, <hi>Is the hast such that it might not have pleased you to have staid till the morning,</hi> they answered, that they were sorry to see her in that case: and I (said she) <hi>am not glad to see you here at this time a night:</hi> they said that they came from the Queene, whose pleasure it was, that she should be at <hi>London</hi> the seventh of that moneth: whereunto she said, <hi>Truly there is no creature more glad then I to come to her Majesty, and am sorry that at this time I am not in case to wait on her, as you see, and may testifie:</hi> They said, they were sorry to see it: yet their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was to bring her either quick, or dead: she being troubled at this, asked, if their commission was <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> so strict: they said yea, and withall called two Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians asking them if she might be removed with life, or noe? which they affirmed that she might in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:117874:102"/> their judgement; thereupon they willed her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare against next morning at nine a clock to goe with them: And accordingly at that time they took her forth, faint and feeble as she was, being ready to <note place="margin">Her great weaknesse.</note> swoune three or foure times betweene them. That night they brought her to <hi>Redborn,</hi> where shee was guarded all night: The next day to St. <hi>Albanes,</hi> where she was both feeble in body, and comfortlesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From thence she was carried to the Court, many people by the way flocking about her, and being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sorry to see her in that case. At Court she was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <note place="margin">Shee is made a prisoner.</note> shut up, and kept a close prisoner for a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, seeing no friend all that time. Then came <hi>Steven Gardiner,</hi> with nineteen more of the Privie Councell, charging her with <hi>Wyats</hi> conspiracy, which she utterly denied, protesting her innocency. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long debating of the businesse, they told her, it was the Queens pleasure, she should go to the Tower. At which she being agast, said, she trusted the Queen would be more gracious to her; still protesting her innocency, and intreating them to mediate for her to the Queen; that seeing she was a true woman to her Majesty, both in thought, word, and deed, she might not be committed to so notorious and dolefull a place: protesting that she desired no favour, if she were found guilty of these things. But the Lords told her, there was no remedy, for that the Queen was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolved that she should goe to the Tower, and so they departed. And about an houre after, came <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

                        <hi>Gardiner</hi> again with three other of the Lords, and <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> the Guard, secluding all her Gentlemen, Ladies and Gentlewomen from her; and in stead of them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed three of the Queenes men, and three other waiting women to attend her, that none should have accesse to her grace. They set also an hundred Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Souldiers to watch in the Gardens all night, and two Lords with their Companies in the House. The Saturday following came two Lords to her, telling her, that she must presently goe to the Tower, the Barge being ready, and the Tide serving, which would tarry for no body.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon she with sorrow intreated them, that she might stay but till the next Tide: But one of them answered, that neither time nor tide must be delayed. Then she requested, that she might be suffered to write to the Queen before she went; but that also was denied her by one of them: but the other (the Earle of <hi>Sussex)</hi> kneeling down, said, she should have liberty to write, and as he was a true man, he would deliver it to the Queen, and bring her an answer, what ever came of it. And so the time and tide pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed away; but they privily prepared all things for her going the next tide, which fell out at midnight: yet fearing lest she should be taken away, they stayed till next day, and then these two Lords came and told her, it was time for her to depart: She bade them goe before, and since there was no remedy, she would follow, adding, that she wondred what the Nobility meant, to suffer her to be led into captivity, the Lord knew whither, for she did not. She shot the bridge with some danger, the Boat striking upon the <note place="margin">Her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:117874:103"/> ground. When she came to the Tower, she refused to land at the Traytors staires; neither could she land, but she must be over her shooes. But one of the Lords said, she should land there. Whereupon shee coming out of the Barge, said, Here lands as true a <note place="margin">Impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Tower.</note> Subject, being a prisoner, as ever landed at these staires, and <hi>before thee, O God, I speak it, having no friends but thee alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At her landing stood many Warders, and others in order; What needs all this, said shee? Going a little further, she sate down on a cold stone to rest her selfe: Then the Lieutenant said, <hi>Madame, you sit unwholsomly, you had best come out of the rain.</hi> To whom she answered, <hi>I had better sit here then in a worse place; for God knoweth, I know not whither you will bring me.</hi> Hereupon her Gentleman Usher wept: To whom she said, <hi>What mean you to use me so? I took you for my comfort, not thus to dismay me, seeing I know my truth to be such, that none shall have cause to weep for me.</hi> And so she went in to prison; The doors were locked and bolted upon her, which much troubled her. Then she called to her Gentlewoman for her Book, desiring God not to suffer her to build her <note place="margin">Her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> foundation upon the sands, but upon the Rock, that so no blustring stormes might prevaile against her.</p>
                     <p>Two dayes after, command came that shee should have Masse said in her Chamber. In the meane time there was much examining and racking of poor men, to force them to accuse her, that they might put her to death. And five dayes after came <hi>Steven Gardiner▪</hi> with others of the Councell, and examined her very strictly about divers things: to whom she at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:117874:103"/>
                        <hi>My Lords you doe sift me very narrowly, but well I am assured you shall not doe more to me then</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Her faith.</note>
                        <hi>God hath appointed, and so God forgive you all.</hi> About that time diverse of her servants, having provided her Diet, brought it to the Tower gate, where the rascally souldiers received it, which so grieved them, that they desired to speake with the Lieuetenant of the Tower, whom they beseeched, that they might not deliver her Graces food to such desperate ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <note place="margin">A chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</note> but that they might carry it to her themselves: but he very churlishly refused, saying, a prisoner she is, and she shall be served as other prisoners are: they replyed, that they expected more favour from him, and perswaded themselves, that the Queene and her Councell would be better to her Grace then so: whereupon he sware by God, that if they either frowned, or shrugged at him, he would set the where they should neither see Sun nor Moone.</p>
                     <p>Thus taking their leave, they prayed God to make him of a better mind to their Mistris: Having thus continued in prison for a moneth, shee began to bee sickly, whereupon she requested the Lieuetenant that <note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> she might have liberty to walke out a little, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying her that favour, she requested, that at least shee might walke into the Queenes Lodgings, but still he pretended that he durst not permit it: <hi>Well</hi> then said she, <hi>if they be so strict, God comfort me:</hi> The next day the Lord <hi>Shandois</hi> came to her, and told her, that he had sued to the Councell for some liberty for her, and had at last obtained, that she might walke into those Lodgings, provided, that the windowes were kept shut, and that the L. <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> and three of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:117874:104"/> the Qs. women did attend her, for which she thanked him, and made use of that little liberty: Afterwards she had leave to walke into a little Garden, the doores being locked upon her, and the prisoners on that side <note place="margin">Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the house being straightly commanded not to speake, nor looke out at windowes, whilst she was there: for this she praysed God, and was well contented with it. During her imprisonment, a little boy foure yeares old, a mans child in the Tower, used sometimes to bring her some flowers, as he did to other prisoners: hereupon the boy, was sent for, and they promised him Figgs and Apples, and then asked him when hee was with the Lady <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> hee answered, every day: then they asked him, when hee was with the Lord of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> and what he sent by him to her Grace: the boy said, I will goe presently to him and know what he will send her: but upon this the Lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant told him, he should be whipt, if hee came any more at them: But, said the boy, I will carry my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mistris some more flowers: whereupon the childs father was commanded, that he should suffer him to goe noe more to their chambers: the next day her Grace walking in the garden, the boy peeped in at a hole, and said, Mistris I must bringe you noe more flowers: whereat she smiled, apprehending what the reason was: this so angred the Lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that he commanded his father to put him out of the Tower: Shortly after, the Constable of the Tower was discharged, and Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> put into his place, who brought with him one hundred souldiers, with which she was much troubled, and and asked, whether the Lady <hi>Ianes</hi> Scaffold was <note place="margin">Her feare.</note>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:117874:104"/> yet taken away, fearing that she should have acted the same Tragedy. Then she enquired, what this Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> was, and whether if her secret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering was required, he was a man of that consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to see it done. They answered, they knew not what he was; but they were perswaded, God would not suffer such wickednesse. Well, said she, God grant it: <hi>For thou, O God, canst mollifie such tyrannous hearts, and disappoint all such cruell purposes: And I</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Her pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note>
                        <hi>beseech thee, to heare me thy creature, which am thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and at thy command, trusting by thy grace ever so to remain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Shortly after, she was told by the Lord <hi>Shandois,</hi> that she must be removed by the new Guard, but he knew not whither, except to <hi>Woodstock.</hi> This much <note place="margin">She is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Wood stock.</note> troubled her, desiring rather to stay there still, then to be led thence with such a sort of Rascals. But he told her, there was no remedy: Accordingly the Sabbath following, Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> (being made her Jaylor) received her to his charge, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Rake-hels for her Guard. The Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> also was joyned in commission with him: The first night they carried her to <hi>Richmond,</hi> where her owne attendance were removed into outward Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and these rude Souldiers appointed to attend on her person.</p>
                     <p>Whereat she suspecting some mischiefe, called her <note place="margin">Her fears.</note>
                        <hi>Ʋsher,</hi> desiring him with the rest, to pray for her: For this night (quoth she) I think to die. But he with many teares endeavoured to comfort her; and going down into the Court, hee met the Lord of <hi>Tame,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Benefield,</hi> walking there, and desiring to speak
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:117874:105"/> with the Lord apart, hee said to him, My Lord, you have alwayes been my good Lord, and so I beseech you to remain; I now desire your Honour unfainedly to tell me, whether any mischiefe be intended to her Grace this night, that I and my poore fellowes may <note place="margin">A faithful servant.</note> take such part as it shall please God to appoint: For certainly we will rather die then that she being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, should secretly miscarry. Mary (said the Lord) God forbid that any such wickednesse should bee wrought; and rather then it should be so, I and my men are ready to die at her feet also. And so through Gods mercy she passed that dolefull night with an heavie heart.</p>
                     <p>The next day, as she passed to <hi>Windsor,</hi> she spied some of her men standing in the way to see her: Wherupon she bade one about her to go to them, and to tell them, <hi>tanquam ovis,</hi> that she was led as a Sheep to the slaughter.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Windsor</hi> she was carried to Mr. <hi>Dormers;</hi> and by the way some poore people presenting her <note place="margin">A churlish Nabal.</note> with some small trifles, Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding angry, calling them Rebels and Traytors, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As she passed through some Townes, they rang the Bells, which so angred <hi>Benefield,</hi> that he sent his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for the Ringers, and set them in the stockes.</p>
                     <p>The next night she went to the Lord of <hi>Tames,</hi> where she was entertained in a very Princely manner. <note place="margin">The Lord of Tames kindnesse to her.</note> At which <hi>Benefield</hi> grunted and grumbled, saying, That they could not answer it, &amp;c. But the Lord of <hi>Tame</hi> told him, that he knew what he did, and that her grace should be merry at his house.</p>
                     <p>The next day she went to <hi>Woodstocke,</hi> where she
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:117874:105"/> was imprisoned closely, the souldiers guarding both within, and with out the walls of the house day, and night: at last she was allowed to walk into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which much refreshed her, yet all the doores were stricktly locked, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> himselfe keeping the Keies, whereupon she called him her jailor, but he desired her not to call him so, but one of her offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, to whom she answered; <hi>From such officers good Lord deliver me.</hi> After a time she made suit to the Councell, that she might have leave to write to the Queene, which at last was permitted, and Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> brought her pen, ink, and paper, standing by whilst she wrote, and then requested that he might be the messenger to carry it: but she told him, she would send one of her owne servants with it: whereupon he replyed, that he thought none of them durst be so bold as to carry it, she being in that case: Yea (said she) I have none sodishonest as not to goe at my request.</p>
                     <p>Well (said he) my commission is to the contrary, and I may not suffer it. Her Grace replyed; you tell me oft of your commission, I pray God you may justly answer the cruell dealing that you use to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. Yet he stopt her letters foure or five daies but at length sent for one of her Gentlemen, and asked him, if he durst be so bold as to carry her letter. Yea said he, that I dare, and will with all my heart: so with an ill will he gave him her letter: She being sickly the Queene sent two of her Physitians, to her▪ <note place="margin">She is sickly.</note> who staid foure, or fiue daies, till she began to amend, and then returned, reporting well of her mild beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and humblenesse towards the Queene. About
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:117874:106"/> which time she was requested to submit her selfe to the Queenes Majesty: but she answered, that she would never submit to them, whom she had never offended, for said she, if I have offended, I craue no <note place="margin">Popish malice.</note> mercy, but the Law, which had I beene guilty of the breach of, I am sure I should have had it before this: About this time a Consultation being held <note place="margin">Kinge of Spaines kindness to her.</note> what should be done with her: One of the Lords said, that it would never be quiet with England, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept her head were stricken off: whereunto the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards <note place="margin">God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects her from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers</note> answered: God forbid, that their King, and master should have a mind to consent to that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: and accordingly they perswaded their King, that he should never get so much honour, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> out of prison, which at length he effected: Whilst she was at <hi>Woodstock,</hi> her life was oft in danger, first by fire kindling under her Chamber boards, which was verily supposed to be done on purpose, yet through Gods mercy, it was quenched: Also a ruffian, that was one of the keepers, was suborned to murther her, which the L. also discovered, and prevented: Also a darling of <hi>Steven Gardiners</hi> was sent to murther her, which was prevented by Sir <hi>Henry Benefields</hi> absence, who had commanded his brother to let no man whatsoever to come to her till his returned: Also whiles she was in the Tower, by <hi>Steven Gardiners</hi> procurement, a writ was sent for her execution, but the <hi>Lieuetenant</hi> presently going to the Queene with it, the Lord was pleased in mercy thereby to prevent the execution of it. At her departure out of <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stock</hi> she wrote with a Diamond in the window.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>Whilst she was there, hearing a milke maide in the Park singing merrily, she wished her self a milkmaid, saying that her case was better, and life more merry then hers in that state as she was. When she was sent for from <hi>Woodstock,</hi> she was by Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> carried in a tempestuous day to <hi>Ricot,</hi> by the way her hood was thrice blowne off, and she desiring to <note place="margin">She wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her selfe a Milkmaid</note> goe to a gentlemans house hard by, <hi>Benefield</hi> would not suffer her, so that she was constrained under an hedge to trimme her head as well as she could: from thence shewas carried to <hi>Colebrook,</hi> and by the way <note place="margin">Popish cruelty.</note> some of her servants meeting of her, which had not seene her of a long time, they were not suffered to speake with her, but were charged in the Queens name presently to depart, to their mutuall sorrow; she was still surrounded and guarded with souldiers, and close shut up in her chamber, as in a prison: From thence she went to <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> where for a fortnight she was shut up, and guarded with souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as before: Then came to her the Lord <hi>William Howard,</hi> who used her very honourably: whereup-she requested him to be a means that she might speake with some of the privy Councell; and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, <hi>Steven Gardiner</hi> with some others of them came to her, to whom she said <hi>My Lords I am glad to see you, me thinks I have beene desolatly alone a great while: wherefore I desire you to mediate to the King, and Queene, that I may be delivered from prison</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Steven Gardiner</hi> requested her to submit her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:117874:107"/> to the Queene, and then he doubted not but she would be good to her: to whom she answered, that <note place="margin">Her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> rather then she would doe so, she would lie in prison all the daies of her life; for she craved no mercy, but rather the Law, in case she had offended: for (said she) <hi>if I should yield to this, I should confesse my selfe to be an offendor, and might give the King and Queene occasion to judge evill of me ever hereafter:</hi> and so the Lords departed. The next day came <hi>Gardiner</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and told her, that the Queene marvelled that she carried her selfe so stoutly, not confessing that she had offended; and therefore the Queene had imprisoned her wrongfully: Nay (said she) it may please her to punish me as she sees good: Well (said <hi>Gardiner)</hi> you must tell an other tale before you be set at liberty: the good Lady answered, that she had as leive be in prison with truth, and honesty, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and suspected of her Majesty.</p>
                     <p>A week after the Queene sent for her at ten a <note place="margin">She goes to the Queene.</note> clock at night, whom she had not seene of two years before, and so she was conducted to the Queens bedchamber; when she came in, she kneeled downe, and prayed God to preserve her Majesty, not doubting but she should proue as true a subject to her as ever any did, desiring her Majesty so to esteem of her, for she should not find her otherwise, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever report she heard to the contrary: the Queene answered, you will not confesse your offence, but stand stoutly to your truth: I pray God it may so fall out: If it doe not (said the L. <hi>Eliz.)</hi> I neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire favour, nor pardon, &amp;c. and so after such like discourse, she was sent away with little comfort from
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:117874:107"/> the Queene: yet a week after she was freed from Sir <hi>Henry Benefield</hi> her keeper, and his souldiers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she went to refresh her selfe in the Countrey: but the Queene sent with her Sir <hi>Thomas Pope,</hi> one of her Councellors, who watched her narrowly all Queene Maries daies: Shortly after came someof the <note place="margin">New trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> Queenes servants, and carried one of her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Fleet, and three others to the Tower, which much troubled her Grace: But it pleased God <note place="margin">

She was now about fiue and twenty yeares old, and by experience, and adversitie had gotten wisdome aboue her age: the next day <note place="margin">She is proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Queene.</note> after she was proclaimed Queene, she came from <hi>Hatfield</hi> to London, and lodged at the Charter house: the next day she went to the Tower: and in her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage had diverse speeches made to her, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of her Subiects joy, and if ever person had the gift, or skill to win the hearts of the people, it was this Queene, she coupled mildnesse with Majesty; &amp; stooped, yet in a stately manner, to the meanest sort. <note place="margin">Her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> All her faculties were in motion, and every moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:117874:108"/> seemed a well-guided action: Her eye was set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, her eare listned to another, her judgement ran upon a third, to a fourth she addressed her speech: Her spirit seemed to be every where, and yet so intire in herselfe, that it seemed to be no where else. Some she commended, some she pitied, some she thanked; contemning none, neglecting none: and generally casting forth such courteous countenances, gestures, and speeches, that thereupon the people redoubled the testimonies of their joy, promising themselves much happinesse under the government of such a Queen.</p>
                     <p>She was of stature tall, slender, straight, and of an amiable countenance: her haire inclined to a pale yellow, her fore-head large and faire, a seemly seat for Princely grace; her eyes lively, her nose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what rising in the middest, the whole compasse of her countenance somewhat long, but yet of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty.</p>
                     <p>In life she was most innocent, in desires moderate, in purpose just, of spirit above credit, and almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the capacity of her Sex: of a Divine wit, as well for depth of judgement, as for quick conceit, and speedy expedition; very eloquent, of wonderfull knowledge both in learning and affaires: skilfull in Greek, Latine, and divers other forraigne languages.</p>
                     <p>She was very religious, magnanimous, mercifull, and just: She maintained justice at home, and Armes abroad, with great wisdome and authority; She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired those that repaired to her, if they would not be deceived in her, that they would not be the first to deceive themselves; that they would not prejudice
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:117874:108"/> her by immoderate expectations and hopes, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to themselves out of a sudden liking, more then was fit, or peradventure possible to be performed: And lastly, that they would not rashly judge of her actions, as being privy neither to the occasions nor ends of them.</p>
                     <p>After some stay at the Tower, she removed to <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset</hi> house: She continued all the Councellors left by the deceased Queen; and to ballance them equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">Her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors.</note> being Papists, she chose divers Protestants to joyn with them; and knowing that sudden alterations are dangerous, she did by degrees abolish Popery, <note place="margin">Popery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished by degrees</note> and established the reformed Religion: then she summoned a Parliament. When she took Coach in the Tower, shee made a solemne thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to God, who had delivered her no lesse merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and mightily, from her imprisonment in that place, then <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lions Den: that had <note place="margin">Her thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> delivered her from those dangers wherewith she was environed, and overwhelmed, to bring her to the joy and honour of that day.</p>
                     <p>As she passed through the City, the Recorder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented her with a curious purse, wherein were a thousand Markes in gold, desiring that she would be a gracious Mistresse to the Citie: She answered, that she was bound so to be, not for their gold, but for their good wills: And that as they had expended treasure to honour her, so she would be ready not onely to spend her treasure, but the dearest drops of her blood to maintaine and increase their flourishing estate.</p>

She cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received Nosegayes, Flowers, Rosemary from mean persons.</p>
                     <p>The Sabbath following, she was crowned at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster:</hi> then she appointed a publick disputation there, about matters of religion; but the Popish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputants <note place="margin">A disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note> shewed themselves so crosse, and froward in it, that it came to nothing.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> hearing of the death of his wife Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> he sent an Embassadour to propose his marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <note place="margin">King of Spain wooes her.</note> with her, promising to get a dispensation from the Pope. This much troubled her, considering his quality, and how much he had deserved of her, and yet now she must reject his suit: Wherefore she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved publickly to make profession of her Religion, and to hasten the Reformation, as the onely meanes to take him off. In the Parliament was enacted, That <note place="margin">Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, and ought both by the Law of God, the common Law of <hi>England,</hi> and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law, to be the lawfull and undoubted Queen of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> The Sacrament was appointed to bee used in both kindes, and divers such like Lawes for establishing the Protestant Religion. Then she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a peace with the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
                     <p>The Commons by their Speaker, endeavoured to perswade her to marriage from many politick grounds.

                     <p>By means of the alteration of Religion, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome became the most free of all the Kingdomes in Christendome, the Scepter being freed from servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Pope: and more wealthy then formerly, an infinite Masse of money being staid at home, which was wont to be exported to <hi>Rome.</hi> She oft used to say, <hi>That the Common-wealth might be in safety, shee was never without care.</hi> Her Motto was, <hi>Semper ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dem, Alwayes the same.</hi> Her study was, as to reform, so to establish the reformed Religion.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they sued to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for aid, and she enquired into their ends, which they proposed, which they professed were to advance the glory of Christ, the sincere preaching of Gods Word, the rooting out of Superstition, and Idolatry, and to preserve their ancient liberty against the oppression of strangers.</p>
                     <p>After the Queen had seriously considered all things, it was resolved, That the professors of the <note place="margin">She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Reformers</note> same Religion were to be relieved, and the <hi>French</hi> to be driven out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Hereupon the Queen sent Mr. <hi>Winter</hi> with a Fleet into <hi>Edinburgh Frith,</hi> who set upon the <hi>French</hi> Ships of Warre, and upon one of their Garrisons. And the Duke of <hi>Norfolke</hi> was sent to <hi>Batwick,</hi> unto whom resorted many of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nobility, where many Articles were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon betwixt them. After which the Queen sent an Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> consisting of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand two hundred Horse, and six thousand Foot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> a brave Souldier: They first besieged <hi>Leith;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> issued forth and skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Leith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged.</note> with them, but were beaten in againe. The siege continuing, the King of <hi>France</hi> sent to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> to treat of a peace; which at last was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and proclaimed in the Camp, and Towne. <note place="margin">Peace con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cluded.</note> Hereby the ancient liberty of <hi>Scotland</hi> was retained, the dignity of <hi>England</hi> preserved, and the <hi>Scottish</hi> Protestants acknowledged our Queen Defendresse of their happinesse.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after, the Queen set forth a Proclamation, whereby she commanded the Anabaptists, and such
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:117874:110"/> like Heretickes, which had flocked to the Coast <note place="margin">Heretickes banished.</note> Townes of <hi>England</hi> from the parts beyond the Sea, (under colour of shunning persecution, and thereby had spread their poisonous opinions in <hi>England)</hi> to depart the Realm within twenty dayes, upon pain of imprisonment, and losse of goods.</p>
                     <p>The Abby of <hi>Westminster</hi> she converted to a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat <note place="margin">Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> Church; instituting to Gods glory, and the increase of good learning, a Dean, twelve Prebends, a Schoolmaster, Usher, and fourty Scholars, six whereof at least are preferred to the Universities year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, twelve Almesmen, &amp;c. Money, which King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth had embased, she restored to its just va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1561. the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen deferred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the aforementioned Treaty: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Queen sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to exhort the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to mutuall amity, which is firmly founded in the unity of Religion.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after, the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen, being now a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and in <hi>France,</hi> sent to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for leave to passe into <hi>Scotland</hi> upon a safe conduct: Which she refused to grant, because she had not, according to her faith given, confirmed the aforenamed Treaty. But yet in a great fogge, shee passed by the <hi>English</hi> Ships, and so got into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time the Pope endeavoured to perswade her, to send some to the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of dissentions in Religion, &amp;c.

                     <p>About this time the Spire of <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple, which <note place="margin">Pauls stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple burnt.</note> was five hundred and twenty foot from the ground, and two hundred and sixty from the square Steeple, being framed of Timber, and covered with lead, was set on fire by lightning; and in five houres space, it was quite consumed, together with the roof of the Church: But by the Queenes bounty, and other large contributions, the roofe was soon repaired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, <note place="margin">She assists the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in France.</note> and oppressed by the Popish party, sent to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> desiring aid from her: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mature deliberation, she took into her protection the <hi>French</hi> Kings subjects in <hi>Normandy,</hi> contracting with the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and other Noble men, to pay them an hundred thousand Angels, and to send them over into <hi>France,</hi> six thousand men. And the same day she published a Declaration, that she sent not her Army into <hi>Normandy</hi> to recover that Countrey, which anciently belonged to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> but to preserve it for the <hi>French</hi> King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet at age, and to defend it against the <hi>Guises,</hi> who had exercised barbarous cruelties against the Protestants, whom she could not neglect, without betraying her own Religion, security, and safety.</p>
                     <p>And shortly after, she sent over Forces under the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> to <hi>New-Haven:</hi> And the Queens

                        <hi>Westminster;</hi> where, amongst other good Lawes, it was ordained, that the Bible, and Service should be translated into the <hi>Welsh</hi> tongue. The yeare <note place="margin">Her enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainmēt at <hi>Cambridg,</hi>
                        </note> after, the Queen in her progresse, went to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where she was entertained with all kinds of honour, and with Comedies, Tragedies, and Scholasticall Disputations: She surveyed every Colledge, and in a <hi>Latine</hi> Oration she acknowledged their love, and kindnesse, commending their multiplicity of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, exhorting them to bend their whole mindes, and studies to the improvement thereof; promising to be a Patronesse to them therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1566. she went to <hi>Oxford</hi> also, where she <note place="margin">And <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1568. some godly Ministers sought earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">A further reformati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on desired.</note> for a reformation of our Church, for abolishing of Episcopacy, &amp; for the setling of the Presbyteriall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in this Kingdome.

                     </p>
                     <p>About this time the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> fled into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

                     <p>About this time many rumors brake forth, that the Earles of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Westmerland</hi> (zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Papists) were raising a rebellion in the North, whereupon the Queene sent to them, to come up to <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland</hi> was partly minded so to doe, but his friends and followers beseeched him, <note place="margin">Treason in the Norh.</note> that he would not faile them, nor the religion of his fathers: telling him, that the Catholicks were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all over <hi>England</hi> to assist him: that some were coming out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> others out of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> from the Duke <hi>de Alva</hi> to joine with him, whereupon he going to the Earle of <hi>Westmerland:</hi> they brake out into open rebellion, publishing these pretences: That they took Arms with no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but that the religion of their forefathers might be restored, corrupt councellors removed from the

                     <p>Then one <hi>William Parry</hi> (whose life the Queen had <note place="margin">

Yet afterwards, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Allens</hi> book, he was so fired with zeale, that he posted to a Gentleman, whom he thought as discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented as himselfe, opening his treason for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of forraigne invaders, and threatning with Dagge or Dagger, to kill the Queen: but the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman revealing it to two privy Councellors, he was apprehended, and confessing his treason, was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:117874:114"/> executed. Hereupon her Majesty in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment openly professed, that she knew no Creature breathing, whose life stood hourly in more perill then her owne: And that even at her first entrance into her estate, she entred into infinite dangers of life, as one that had to wrestle with many and mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <note place="margin">God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects his own.</note> yet was she confident of her heavenly Fathers protection, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after, as she was upon the <hi>Thames</hi> in her Barge with the <hi>French</hi> Embassador, and some others, a Serving-man with his Caleiver shot a bullet, which pierced both the armes of one of the Water-men; within six foot of the Queen: With which all in the <note place="margin">Courage.</note> Barge were astonished; but she being undaunted, and seeing the man bleed, threw him her scarfe, and with words of comfort, bade him be of good cheere, he should never want: for the bullet was aimed at her, though it hit him: yet afterwards knowing that it was done casually, she both pardoned the party, and commanded his master to keep him still in his service. She was of such singular clemency, that she never <note place="margin">Clemency.</note> heard of the capital punishment of offenders, even of such as had sought her own death, but it bred horror, and sorrow in her; so that had not her Councellors earnestly inculcated the necessity of such exemplary Justice, many dangerous attempts had escaped their due punishment, which moved her to say, that her reading of <hi>Seneca de clementia,</hi> had done her much good; but some would perswade her, it had done her State as much harm.</p>
                     <p>Her love to her people in generall, and tender care over the poorer sort, and oppressed, was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:

                        <hi>you to them that which I ought to doe: they are my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet every one oppresseth and spoileth them without mercy: they can neither help themselves, nor revenge their quarrell: See to them, I pray you, see to them, for they are my charge; them therefore I charge you with as God hath committed them to me: I care not for my selfe, my life is not deare unto me; my care is for my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

                     <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> bore a port and presence,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:117874:145"/> full of Majesty: was of a gallant stature, aboue six foot high: full fac't: had an hawkseie: of yellowish haire: he was cleane limb'd, strong, active, and hardy: of an undaunted courage: a strong judgment: an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quicknesse of conceite; of a naturall vigilancy, and indefatigablenesse: had a marvellous forecast, to apprehend and dispose of his affaires to the best advantage: He had an excellent dexterity to extricate, &amp; untangle the Gordian knottinesse of a businesse: he knew how to take advantage of mens humours: and had a native attraction in him to win hearts, as well as provinces: He was a great student upon any business of Importance: a diligent disputer, and canvasser of the answere which he was to give to Ambassadors. A sudden danger seldome astonished his judgment: but the more desperate the perill was, the nimbler was he in his deliveries: still shewing most vigour, where there was most need of it: He was exceeding temperate in his diet: his feeding was upon strong and souldierly dishes: But that which was most commendable in him, was his Religion both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <note place="margin">His Piety.</note> and Private: He was frequent in prayers and thanksgivings, upon every emergent occasion: He would pray a shipboard, a shoare, in the field, in the middest of a Battell, as if prayer alone were the surest piece of his whole Armour: He was a strict observer of Martiall discipline: and a strict punisher of misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors in his Camp: When he first came into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> he saw that many women followed his Army, whereupon coming to a great river, his men and waggons being passed over, he caused the bridge to be broken downe, hoping thereby to be rid of this

The Castell stood in an Iland in the mouth of the most raging and swift ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Nerva,</hi> his Colonells despairing of taking it, and loth that their young King should receiue a check in his first attempts, labour to disswade him from the Action: yet he continued resolute to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue it: and see how almighty God wrought for him: the besieged <hi>Muscovites</hi> were stricken with such thrushes, warts, and blisters in their throates and mouths, that they could neither chew their meate, nor swallow, whereupon they parlied, and yielded <note place="margin">A speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> up that impregnable Castell to him, wherein he found a whole yeares victualls, besides abundance of ammunition.</p>
                     <p>Not long after this, he had a difference with the <hi>Dantzickers,</hi> who prepared twenty or thirty good ships of warr, with the first opening of the spring to have burnt up his Navie in the harbour: but

Hereupon they concluded, that without any further delay, process should be awarded out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as against a most pernicious Heretick: But some, of more wisdom and crafty experience then the rest, advised that the matter should not be handled so rashly; but seeing that the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was a man of great birth, and in great favour with the King at this time, that therefore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117874:155"/> they should first make the King acquainted with the business, and procure his approbation, and consent before they summoned him: This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was well liked of, and thereupon <hi>Arundel,</hi> with his other Bishops, addressed themselves straite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to the King, laying forth before him most grievous complaints against the said Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> to the great disgrace of that godly man. The King gently heard these blood-thirsty Prelates, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in those dark daies they kept Kings in aw, yet he requested, and instantly desired them, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Noble Stock, and for that he was his Knight, they would deal mildly, and favourably with him, seeking to regain him with gentleness, rather then by rigorous dealing: He promised al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that if they would have a little patience, he would seriously commune with him himself about those matters: Thus having pacified them for the present, he shortly after sent for the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> to him, advising him as an obedient child to submit himself to the Church, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himself culpable: To whom this Christian Knight answered: <hi>You most worthy Prince, I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Christian Courage.</note>
                        <hi>willing, and ready to obey, for as much as I know you to be the Minister of God, bearing the Sword for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well: unto you, next to my eternal God, I owe my whole obedience, and submit all that I have unto you, being ready at all times to do whatsoever you shall in the Lord command me: but as touching the Pope, and his spiritualty, I owe them neither sute nor service; knowing him by the Scriptures to be the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117874:156"/>
                        <hi>the son of Perdition, the open adversary of God, and the abomination standing in the holy place.</hi> When the King had heard this stout and godly answer, he left him; And (not indeed daring to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) he gave the Archbishop leave to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him as he saw fit: Then the Archbishop, with the consent of his other Bishops, resolved to call the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> before them, personally to appear, and to make answer to such Articles as they should charge him with; and for this end they sent forth their chief Sumner with a very strict Citation to the Castle of <hi>Couling,</hi> where he then lived, to cite him; but when the Sumner came thither, he durst by no means enter into his Castle gates without his License, and therefore after a while, returned to his Masters, as wise as he went. Then the Archbishop suborned one <hi>John Butler,</hi> who was. Door-keeper of the Kings privy <note place="margin">Popish Lies.</note> Chamber, with large promises of reward, to go with his Sumner to cite the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> who accordingly went to him, falsly informing him, that he was sent by the King, to tell him that it was his mind that he should obey the process, and make his appearance: But the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Courage.</note> answered, that he would in no case consent to those divellish practises of the Priests; with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer they returned, and told the Archbishop that no man could safely, without perill of his life, cite him any more: Hereupon he decreed presently to send down Citatory Letters to be set upon the great Church Doors in <hi>Rochester,</hi> which was but three miles from <hi>Couling</hi> Castle; but as soon as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117874:156"/> the Letters were set up, they were pulled down again, by some friends and favourers of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and thus the Archbishop was served twice, or thrice: and yet when the day came, and he appeared not, they condemned him of most <note place="margin">Popish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> deep contumacy; and hearing by some of his fawning spies, that the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> laughed the Archbishop to scorn, and disdained all his doings, he then proceeded to excommunicate him, and withall, set up a new Citation, wherein he cruelly threatened, that if he did not appear at the day, he would handle him more extreamly; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he commanded the Lay-power, under pain of terrible curses, to assist him against this seditious Apostate, Schismatick, Heretick, and troubler of the publick peace, &amp;c. with such like odious names. But this worthy and constant servant of the Lord seeing the fury of Antichrist, and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers thus kindled against him; perceiving also that he was compassed about with deadly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, he wrote a most Christian Confession of his Faith, Signing and Sealing it with his own hand, <note place="margin">Confession of his Faith.</note> wherein also he answered to four of the chiefest Articles that they laid to his Charge, and so taking it along with him, he went to the King, trusting to find mercy, and favour at his hands: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Confession of his Faith thus: <hi>All the premises I believe particularly, and generally all that God hath left recorded in his holy Word; and therefore I desire you my Liege Lord, and most worthy King, that this Confession of mine may be justly examined by the most godly, wise, and learned men of your Realm: if</hi>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117874:157"/>
                        <hi>it be found agreeable to Gods Word, let it be allowed, if otherwise, let it be condemned: provided alwaies that I be taught a better belief by the holy Scriptures; and I shall at all times most reverently submit to the same:</hi> But the King, over-awed by the Bishop, rejected it, bidding him to deliver it to those that should be his Judges: then he desired before the King, that he might have an hundred Knights, and Esquires to be his Compurgators, which he knew would clear him of all Heresie: Also he offered after the <note place="margin">Valour.</note> Law of Arms, to fight with any man living, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, or Heathen, in the quarrell of his Faith, the King and his Councell being excepted: Lastly, he protested that he would refuse no correction that should be inflicted upon him according to the Laws of God, &amp;c. Yet for all this the King suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him personally to be summoned in his privy Chamber. Then the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> said that he had appealed from the Archbishop, and therefore he ought not to be his Judge; this made the King very angry, and when he refused to be sworn to submit to the Archbishop, he was arrested, and led to the Tower till the day of his appearance. In the mean time he caused the Confession of his Faith to be written out again. When he was brought before the Archbishop, and his Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Archbishop proffered to absolve him, if he would humbly desire it: <hi>Cobham</hi> told him that he was ready to make a rehearsall of his Faith, if they would give him leave, and so drawing it out of his bosom, he read it before them all, and then delivered it to the Bishop. After private consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117874:157"/> amongst themselves, they told him that <note place="margin">Popish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty.</note> there were many good things contained in his Confession, but for the present they must examine him upon other matters; then they examined him about the Sacrament of the Altar, and Pennance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he told them that he would no otherwise declare his minde, then was expressed in his write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Archbishop said, that if he would not fully and cleerly answer to the Articles proposed, they would adjudge him an Heretick: <hi>Do as ye think</hi>

                        <hi>best</hi> (said <hi>Cobham) for I am at a point: that which I have written, I will stand too to the death;</hi> The Bishops were amazed at his stout answer, and so returned him to the Tower till Monday following, at which time the Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir <hi>Robert Morley,</hi> brought him before them again; then the Archbishop told him that he was (as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he proffered) ready to absolve him, if he humbly desired it: No, said the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> I will not, for I never yet trespassed against you, and so kneeling down, and lifting up his eies, and hands towards heaven, he said, <hi>I shrive me here unto thee</hi>

                        <hi>ZIsca</hi> was born in <hi>Trosnovia,</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> of an ancient, and noble fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and from his youth was brought up in the Kings Court, and was much imployed in Military affairs; wherein he profited so well, that he became an able, and skilfull Captain: and fighting vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117874:160"/> in a battell against his enemies, he lost one of his eies; but it pleased God to recompence that outward loss by enlightning his mind with the knowledge of the truth, by the help of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs</hi>

But the Emperor being preparing to go against the Turk, that had lately taken some Castles from him, could not assist her. She therefore taking all the Kings treasure, fortified the Castle of <hi>Prague,</hi> and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117874:160"/> the lesser City adjoining unto it; making Gates, and Towers upon the bridge over the river, to stop the passage of the Protestants that way; in the mean time the number of Protestants encreasing in <hi>Prague,</hi> they fought for the bridge so furiously, <note place="margin">A fight.</note> that many were slain on both parts, but at length the <hi>Hussits</hi> woon the bridge, and the neither part of the lesser <hi>Prague;</hi> the Popish party for the Queen flying into the upper part, &amp; then turning again, the battel was renewed, where they fought continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, day, and night, for five dayes together; But during this bickering Ambassadors came from the Emperor, which made a truce amongst them, and agreed that certain places being by <hi>Zisca</hi> delivered back into their hands, they should send Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the Emperor <hi>Sigismund</hi> to treat with him about the setling of their estate. This both sides consented to, and thereupon peace ensued for the present: But the Emperor being now at better <note place="margin">Blind zeal.</note> leasure, that he might shew his zeal for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish cause, and perform his promise to the Fathers at the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> raises a great Army, wherewith he resolved to root out all the <hi>Hussites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but before he enters into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he goes with his Army to <hi>Ʋratistavia,</hi> the chief City in <hi>Silesia,</hi> where he banished some, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned others, seised upon the estate of others, and <note place="margin">Popish cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> many he put to cruell deaths, and all this (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gave out) that he might strike a terror into the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and make them obedient to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> this coming to the ears of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and they shortly after meeting with some of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117874:161"/> Emperors Letters, wherein he wrote, that he would come speedily, and rule them after the same order, and manner as his Father <hi>Charls</hi> had done before him. Thereupon they seeing that their Religion, Liberty, and all that was dear unto them, lay at stake, resolve to arm for their own defence, and to repell unjust Tyranny by lawfull force, and chose this noble <hi>Zisca</hi> for their generall; and drawing the Governor of the Castle of <hi>Prague,</hi> called <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> to their part, they sent Letters into all the Realm, that no man should suffer the Emperor to enter, who was an enemy to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> seeking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but to destroy the Kingdom, and one that had put by the Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> whom they had chosen for their King, and had not only suffered <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierom of Prague</hi> to be burned at the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> contrary to his Faith given, but had also procured the same, and with all his endeavor sought to extirpate the Doctrine, and Faith which they taught, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: In the mean time <hi>Zisca</hi> was set upon by the Imperialists, who were all horsemen, and <hi>Zisca's</hi> souldiers were all on foot; the place where they fought was rough, and rugged, so that the hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were fain to alight, and fight on foot; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Zisca</hi> commanded all the women that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Army, to throw their Kerchiefs on the <note place="margin">A Stratagem</note> ground, wherein the horsemen being intangled by their spurs, were slain before they could unloose their feet; and by this policy he got a great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">A great victory.</note> over them; then he went to <hi>Ausca,</hi> out of which Town, <hi>Ʋlricius,</hi> a Papist, had cast out the Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:117874:161"/> This place <hi>Zisca</hi> took by Storm, set it on fire, and razed it: he took also a Castle which was a mile off, whither <hi>Ʋlricius</hi> was fled, putting him, and all his family, save one, to the sword; Then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that he had no walled, or fenced Town to inhabite, he chose out a mountain that was fenced <note place="margin">Thabor built.</note> by nature between two Rivers; This place he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in with wals, commanding his followers to build them houses, where they had pitched their Tents, and named the City <hi>Thabor,</hi> and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants his followers, <hi>Thaborites;</hi> the way to it by Land was scarse thirty foot broad, in which neck of Land, he made a deep trench, and a triple wall of such thickness, that it could not be broken with any Engine. At this time the <hi>Thaborites</hi> had no horsemen, but the Emperor sending one of his officers with a thousand horsemen into <hi>Bohemia</hi> to <note place="margin">A victory.</note> resist <hi>Zisca,</hi> he fel upon them in their Quarters in the night, took away all their Horses, and Armor, and set the Town on fire where they lay; and then he taught his souldiers to mount on Horseback; to leap, run, turn, cast in a ring, so that after this, he never led Army without his wings of horsemen: In the mean time the Emperor <hi>Sigismund</hi> gathering together the Nobles of <hi>Silesia,</hi> entred into <hi>Bohemia</hi> with a great Army, marched to <hi>Prague,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised <hi>Cencho</hi> that kept the Castle, to surrender it to him; Hereupon the Citizens of <hi>Prague</hi> sent for <hi>Zisca,</hi> who came with his <hi>Thaborites</hi> to assist them, and received the City under his government. His first design was to besiege the Castle, which was so strongly fenced, that it could not be forced but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117874:162"/> by famine, whereupon he blocked up all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to it; But the Emperor coming with a very great Army, opened them again, and laid siege to the City of <hi>Prague,</hi> and assaulted it often for six weeks space; he sent out also part of his Army to seize upon the Tents of the <hi>Thaborites,</hi> against whom <hi>Zisca</hi> sent forth some power under the <note place="margin">A victory.</note> command of <hi>Nich. Hus,</hi> who beat the Imperialists, and took in <hi>Grecium,</hi> the Queens City also. Neer to <hi>Prague</hi> there is an high hill, on the top whereof <hi>Zisca</hi> planted a strong Garrison, that it should not come into the power of his enemies: against this garrison the Emperor sent the Marquess of <hi>Misnia,</hi> with many souldiers, who getting to the top of the hill, were so lustily set upon by <hi>Zisca's</hi> men, that they were beaten into a corner, where the rock was very craggy, and steep, and there they set so fiercely upon them, that when the <hi>Misnians</hi> could no longer resist, they were driven down the steep rock, where they were broken to peeces. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Emperor, raising his siege, departed, and <hi>Zisca</hi> with his men returned to <hi>Thabor.</hi> But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the Popish Clergy in <hi>Bohemia</hi> were the procurers of the cruell burning of <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierom of Prague</hi> at <hi>Constance,</hi> and that now also they had set on the Emperor against the <hi>Hussites,</hi> helpt to pay his Army, and had joyned with him in murthering the innocent servants of Jesus <note place="margin">Popish cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> Christ, drowning some, roasting others before a soft fire, thrusting others into the mettall-mines; yea that their malice, and hatred was grown to that height, that they sold them like cattel, giving a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117874:162"/> Florene for an ordinary Christian, and five Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens for a Minister, whom they excrutiated with all maner of Torments; he thereupon resolved to pay them back in their own coin, and in prosecution thereof, he burnt, destroyed, and overthrew three hundred Monasteries, and amongst the rest the <note place="margin">Just revenge.</note> famous Monastery called the <hi>Kings Court,</hi> a mile from <hi>Prague,</hi> in the wals whereof the whole Bible was most exquisitely written in letters of Gold; the Monks, and Friers he drave out, and caused ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to betake themselves to labor, or to seek to other places for shelter.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after he took in many places, and then besieged the Castle of <hi>Visgrade;</hi> the besieged were brought to great straits, insomuch as they were forced to live upon their horses; at length they came to composition, that if they were not relieved by the Emperor by a certain day, they should surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Castle to him; the Emperor hearing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, marched to the relief of it with a strong Army, but entering into a narrow passage neer the Castle, he was suddenly set upon by the Protestants, who <note place="margin">A great victory.</note> gave him a great overthrow, which caused him to depart without effecting his purpose, and so the Castle was surrendred to <hi>Zisca;</hi> presently after he took one of the Imperiall Captains in a strong Town; he also took, and burned down five Monasteries, and then sate down before the strong Monastery of <hi>Saint Clare.</hi> Thither also came the Emperor with a great Army, but when <hi>Zisca</hi>

But when <hi>Zisca</hi> (although he was blind) came towards him, he was in a great fear, yet a battel was fought, wherein <hi>Zisca</hi> slew many of his Nobles, and common souldiers, insomuch as the <note place="margin">

                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:117874:163"/> Nobility. <hi>Zisca</hi> having obtained this victory, would not suffer any Images, or Idols to continue in the Churches, neither would he suffer the Priests <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> to wear Copes, and vestments; After this <hi>Zisca</hi> marched with a great Army into <hi>Austria,</hi> where the husbandmen drave, and carried a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Cattell into an Island in the river <hi>Danubius,</hi> but leaving, for hast, some Calves, and Swine behind them, <hi>Zisca</hi> caused his souldiers to <note place="margin">A stratagem.</note> drive them to the rivers side, where they made them roar, and bleat, which the Cattell in the Island hearing, swam over to them, whereby <hi>Zis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> got a great booty, and so returned home. Then the Emperor delivered to the Marquess of <hi>Misnia,</hi> the bridge, and Town of <hi>Asca</hi> upon the river <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> to plant a strong Garrison in; Thither <hi>Zisca</hi> went, and besieged it; whereupon the Marquess raised a great Army out of <hi>Saxony, Thuringia, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117874:164"/> commanded his Standard to stand stil, exhorting, &amp; encouraging his men to give them battell, which accordingly they did; the battell was very fierce, and cruell on both sides, yet at last <hi>Zisca</hi> had the <note place="margin">A victory.</note> upper hand, and slew three thousand of them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rest to flight, and strait he took the City of <hi>Cuthna</hi> by force, which they of <hi>Prague</hi> had garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and burnt it down, and so with all speed he marched with his Army to besiege <hi>Prague;</hi> But his souldiers being not pleased with it, began to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, saying, that it was not reasonable that the Regall City should be suppressed, especially not dissenting from them in opinion; that the Emperor would make great advantage of these their divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These speeches coming to <hi>Zisca's</hi> ears, he called together his Army, &amp; speak thus unto them. <hi>Brethren, blame not me that have sought your health,</hi>

                        <hi>The Life of</hi> John Picus <hi>Earl of</hi> Mirandula, <hi>who dyed,</hi> Anno Christi, 1494.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IOhn Picus</hi> was born <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1463. of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Honorable Family in <hi>Italy,</hi> that deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their pedigreee from <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great: a little before his Mother was delivered of him, there appeared in her Bed-chamber a round flame of fire hanging (as it were) on the wall for a little while, and then vanishing away, concerning which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117874:166"/> there were many conjectures: When he had passed over his childhood, under the care and tuition of his Mother, he was placed under able and learned School-masters, where he applyed himself with so much ardour, and diligence to his book, that in a short time, he became a very good Orator and Poet. He was of a very quick apprehension, rich phansie, excellent invention, and sound memory, <note place="margin">A strong memory.</note> insomuch as having heard sundry verses once read over, after a little meditation, he was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them forwards and backwards, to the great admiration of all that heard him: When he was fourteen years old, his Mother, desiring to fit him (being her youngest Son) for the entrance into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Orders, as the way to preferment, sent him to <hi>Bononia</hi> to study the Civil Law: when he had spent 2 years in that study, wherein he made a very good progress, perceiving that it depended most upon precidents, and traditions, he grew weary of it, yet as young as he was, in that space he made an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Popes <hi>Epistles</hi> and <hi>Decretals,</hi> which was excellently well approved of by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. But being exceeding desirous to search out the secrets of Nature, he left these beaten paths, &amp; betook himself to the study of Philosophy, and for his furtherance therein, he travelled to all the Famous Universities of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">His travels.</note> himself with the most learned men in them; and took such extraordinary pains in his study, that in a little time he became an exquisite Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and an excellent Divine; and so having spent seven years in these Studies, being ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:117874:166"/> desirous of renown and credit in the world, <note place="margin">Ambition.</note> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he publikely set up nine hundred questions of Logick, Mathematicks, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, Divinity, &amp;c. not onely out of <hi>Latine</hi> Authors, but <hi>Greek, Hebrew, Chalde, Arabick,</hi> as also out of the <hi>Hebrew Cabala,</hi> &amp; the old Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, <hi>Pythagoras, Trimegistus, Orpheus, &amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides some of Naturall Magick. He also set up seventy two more questions, not formerly discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by any Authors, but found out by himself, in Philosophy, and Metaphysicks, and withall he promised to bear the charges of such learned men as should come out of other Countries to dispute with him upon those questions. But this doing, procuring him much envie, caused that his Antagonists would never suffer him to come to a <note place="margin">Envie.</note> publike disputation upon them: yet privately they scanned them over very curiously, and complained that divers of them were contrary to the true Faith: But he not enduring the least disgrace, in twenty days space published a learned Apology, wherein he justified his questions, as being nothing at all contrary to the Catholick Faith: Concluding with that of St. <hi>Augustine: Errare possum, haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus esse non possum, quando alterum sit hominis proprium, alterum perversae, &amp; obstinatae voluntatis:</hi> I may err, but I will not be an heretick, the first being proper to man, but the other a property of <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> an obstinate, and perverse will: He was of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty, tall of stature, of a comly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, lively eies, and his hair of a yellowish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, of a noble stock, and great riches, insomuch
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:117874:167"/> that many Ladies, and gentlewomen fell in love with him whilest he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and so inveagled him, being of a tractable, and courteous dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he began to give over himself in this his heat of youth, to unlawfull pleasures with them: But it pleased God by the malice of his adversaries, &amp; the troubles which he met with by their means, to awaken him from his sensuall delights, and to stir him up to shake off, and avoid all these provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and incentives to wickedness, and to choose celestiall, instead of fleshly pleasures: and laying aside his hunting after vain glory, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applause, to dedicate, and devote himself to the glory of God, and the good of his Church: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving <note place="margin">Conversion.</note> for the time to come, so to carry himself, through Gods assistance, that his adversaries should have nothing to object against him.</p>
                     <p>His same being spred abroad, many great schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers repaired to him, some to dispute with him, and to try whether his learning was answerable to the report that went of it, others to learn, and be instructed of him: And whereas he had written some love verses in his youth, he burnt them all, and some other unprofitable writings: then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himself seriously to the study of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and being twenty eight years old, he wrote <note place="margin">Scriptures studied.</note> a learned Tractate of the six first days work of God, and another of the Sabbath, for the publick benefit of the Church. He was wonderfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Elegancy of the Scriptures, in their Originals, especially of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles, which he preferred before all humane Eloquence whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117874:167"/> professing that the writings of <hi>Tully, Demost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes, &amp;c.</hi> were not to be compared with them. Then he wrote his Book <hi>De Ente &amp; uno,</hi> stuffed with abundance of learning: He wrote much also for interpreting the old Testament, and reconciling seeming differences: He justified the translation of <hi>Hierom</hi> against the calumnies of the Jews: He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so defended the <hi>Septuagint</hi> translation, principally in reference to the Psalms: He wrote also about the true computation of Times: He wrote much in defence of the Catholick Faith, against <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, Iews,</hi> and other opposers of it: many other excellent works he had begun, but being cut off by an immature death, he left them unfinished: and his writing was so bad, that few could col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect his sence by it: He read over whole Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Industry.</note> both of <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Authors with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable celerity, and yet culled out the most usefull things as he went through them: He was so ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the ancient Fathers, as if he had made them his only study all his life long: He was so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Modern Writers, that if any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was proposed to him out of them, he could presently resolve it, as if he had been of their Counsel in writing: He was an acute and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Disputant, which he much delighted in: He always preferred those disputations which were <note place="margin">Humility.</note> privately undertaken, with an humble and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mind, to find out the truth, rather then to get the Victory: But could not endure such publick disputations as were undertaken to shew learning, or to win applause from the common people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117874:168"/> that they did very much hurt: He had a very great Library of Ancient and Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, of all sorts and Languages: He was of such an indefatigable Spirit, that he was never a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his study: Three years before his death, he retired himself from the pleasures, profits and honors of the world, &amp; that he might live a more private life, He made over almost all his estate in the Earldoms of <hi>Mirandula</hi> and <hi>Concordia,</hi> to his Brothers Son: a great part of his Mony, Plate and Jewels he distributed amongst the poor: He <note place="margin">Charity.</note> kept a frugall Table, which he well contented himself with: He was constant in his daily pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God: He relieved the poor every day: He <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> gave much mony to poor maids, for preferring them in marriage: He imployed an intimate friend to enquire out the wants and necessities of poor House-keepers, whom he bountifully relieved: He kept under his body by fasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was of a cheerfull countenance, and of so composed a mind, that he was scarce ever seen angry: He was very humble, being so far from seeking and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great honors, and offices, that he could not be <note place="margin">Humility.</note> perswaded to accept of them: His usual discourse amongst his friends was of the vanity and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all Earthly things, and of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Heavenly things, and therefore he would often call upon them to love the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He did so little regard these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, that he was often blamed by his friends for too much neglect of them: He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways most cordially affected to his friends, whom
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117874:168"/> he chose for the similitude of manners and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Love to his friends.</note> rather then for other outward respects of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>&amp;c. Angelus Policianus,</hi> and <hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi> were two of his most intimate friends: But falling into a violent Feavour, which contemned all means of cure, in thirteen days space he quietly departed, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1494. and of his Age 32.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>THomas Cromwel</hi> was born at <hi>Putney</hi> in <hi>Surrey;</hi> his Father was a Smith, and therefore could bestow no great cost in his education, so that his poverty was a great hinderance at first to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; yet such was the activity, and forward ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of nature in him: his wit so pregnant: his judgement so sound: his tongue so eloquent: his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117874:169"/> service so faithful: His stomack so couragious, &amp; his Pen so active, that he could not be long concealed, nor hindred from favour, &amp; friends to imploy him: Nothing was so difficult which his wit &amp; industry would not compass, he had also a very firm memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in retaining whatsoever he had once gotten, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as in a journy to, and from <hi>Rome</hi> he learned the whole New Testament translated by <hi>Erasmus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Scriptures studied.</note> without book: As he grew towards ripeness of years, he had a great minde to travel into forraign Countries to see the world, and learn experience, and so passing over the sea, he went into <hi>France,</hi> from thence into <hi>Italy,</hi> at last he came back to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where he was entertained by the <hi>English</hi> Merchants to be their Secretary: It hapned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same time, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> were minded to send to <hi>Rome</hi> for the renewing of their two Pardons, which, though it would cost them great expenses, yet they found such gain by that <hi>Roman</hi> Merchandise, that they chose one <hi>Jeffery Chambers,</hi> and another, whom they furnished with Writings, and good store of money, and so sent them to <hi>Rome</hi> to dispatch that business: By the way when they came to <hi>Antwerp, Chambers</hi> suspecting his own weakness for so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a work, conferred, and prevailed with <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> to assist him therein: <hi>Cromwell,</hi> though he knew the difficulty of the enterprise, and what it was to have to deal with such greedy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants, as the Pope, and his Cardinals were, yet having some skill in the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue, and as yet being ungrounded in the true Religion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117874:170"/> to go along with them. Coming to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The sensual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Pope.</note> he gat Information, that the Popes holy Tooth greatly delighted in new fangled dishes, and strange delicates, whereupon he prepared certain fine dishes of jelly, made after the best <hi>English</hi> fashion, but never before seen at <hi>Rome:</hi> And taking his time with his two companions, when the Pope was newly come from Hunting, and gone into his Pavilion, they brought their <hi>English</hi> Presents in with a three mans Song (as it was then called) The Pope marvelling at the strangeness of the Song, and understanding that they were <hi>English</hi> men, and came not empty handed, he willed them to be called in: <hi>Cromwell</hi> doing his obeysance, offered him his jolly-junkets, telling him, that they were such as none but Kings, and Princes in <hi>England</hi> used to feed upon: Desiring him to accept of the Present which he, and his Companions, that were poor suiters to his Holiness, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as novelties for his recreation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Pope seeing the strangeness of the Dishes, bad one of his Cardinals to tast of it, who liked it so well, that he commended it to the Pope: The Pope also was so well pleased with it, that he asked them what their suits were, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to teach his Cook the making of that meat, he incontinently confirmed both their Pardons according to their requests: All this while <hi>Cromwell</hi> had no sound tast of Religion, and himself would often after tell Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> what a Ruffian he was in his young dayes: How he was in the wars with the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:117874:170"/> fiege of <hi>Rome:</hi> As also how he assisted <hi>Chambers</hi> in publishing, and setting forth the Pardon of <hi>Boston</hi> every where in Churches as he went, and so he <note place="margin">The means of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</note> continued, till at last, learning the New Testament by heart, it pleased God to begin to touch, and affect his heart with the knowledge, and savor of the Truth: In the mean time, Cardinal <hi>Woolsey</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rule all under the King, or rather with the King in <hi>England;</hi> so that men of the best wits, and ablest parts, sought to get into his service: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> also gat prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under him, and having faithfully served him divers years, the Cardinal at last preferred him to be his Solicitour: About which time <hi>Woolsey</hi> was building his stately Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> [now <hi>Christ-Church]</hi> for the furtherance whereof, he pulled down some small Monasteries, and Priories in divers parts of the Realm, the charge whereof he committed to <hi>Cromwell,</hi> wherein he was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious, that he gat him much hatred amongst many superstitious persons, and with some of <note place="margin">He is hated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> the Nobility that were about the King.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after the Cardinal grew into disgrace with the King, and fell into a <hi>Premunire:</hi> So that his houshold being dissolved, <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> amongst others, sought to get into the Kings Service: And Sir <hi>Christopher Hales,</hi> Master of the Rolls (though a great Papist) yet liked <hi>Cromwell</hi> so well, that he commended him to the King, as a man most fit for his purpose, having then to do against the Pope. But the King having had former complaint made to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:117874:171"/> him against <hi>Cromwell,</hi> for his homely dealing with the Monasteries, Images, Altars, &amp;c. he detested his very name, and some that stood by also, with railing, and reviling words, sought more to inflame the Kings hatred against him: But there being present at the same time, the Lord <hi>Russell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> with a vehement boldness he stood forth, <note place="margin">Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and took upon him the defence of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much in his commendation before the King; and withall, telling him, that when himself was at <hi>Bononia,</hi> about the Kings affairs, he was in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream perill of his life, had not <hi>Cromwell</hi> by his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular device and policy freed him from the same: Adding, that forasmuch as his Majesty had now to do with the Pope, there was in all <hi>England</hi> none so fit for the Kings purpose, which could say or do <note place="margin">He is sent for to the King.</note> more in that matter then he: The King hearing this, was content to see, and speak with him, and to hear what he could say: <hi>Cromwell</hi> having pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate notice that he should be sent for to the King, provided himself before hand, and gat in a readiness the Copy of the Bishops oath, which they used to make to the Pope at their consecration, and so being called for, he was brought to the King in his garden at <hi>Westminster, Anno Christi</hi> 1530. the King propounding sundry questions to him, He answered him very satisfactorily, and withall shewed him how his Princely authority was abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed within his own Realm by the Pope, and his Clergy, who being sworn to him, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dispensed with, and sworn anew unto the Pope, so that he was but an half King, &amp;c. He
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117874:171"/> also shewed him how he might accumulate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self whatsoever the Clergy in <hi>England</hi> was worth, if he pleased to take the occasion now offered unto him: The King giving good ear to this, and liking his advise, asked him, if he would stand by what he had told him: Yea said he, I can avouch it to be certain, and therewith he shewed the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops oath unto the King: Hereupon the King pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently admitted him into his service, and taking his Ring off his finger, he sent him therewith into <note place="margin">Admitted into the Kings, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> the Convocation house amongst the Bishops: <hi>Cromwell</hi> coming boldly into the house, placed himself amongst the Bishops, where he made an Oration, and declared unto them the authority of a King, and the office of subjects, especially of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Churchmen under the publike Laws, which Laws (saith he) you have all transgressed, &amp; highly offended by derogating from the Kings Roiall estate, falling under a <hi>Premunire,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the power Legantine of the Cardinal, as also by being sworn to the Pope, contrary to your fealty to the King, to whom therefore you have forfeited all your Goods, Chattels, Lands, Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, <note place="margin">Proves the Clergy to be in a Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire.</note> and whatsoever Livings you have: The Bishops hearing this, were much amazed, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to excuse, and deny the fact: But <hi>Cromwell</hi> shewing to them the very Copy of the oath given to the Pope at their consecration, they could deny the matter no longer, but fell to intreaty: And after a short debate amongst themselves were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give to the King 101884. li. to free them from the <hi>Premunire:</hi> After this <hi>Cromwell</hi> growing <note place="margin">His prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</note>

                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Romes</hi> power being thus abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>England,</hi> there were yet divers Popish <note place="margin">His zeal for the Truth.</note> Bishops, his creatures, which privily watched all opportunities to restore it again: But <hi>Cromwell</hi> (as a mighty wall, and defence of the Church) resisted it continually, and so frustrated all their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and endeavors: About this time some tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults <note place="margin">Tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> began to arise about Religion: Whereupon the King Summoned, and Assembled most of his Bishops, and Learned men to meet, and treat soberly, and modestly about most of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal points: To this Convocation, <hi>Cromwel</hi> went, and accidentally by the way he met with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Alesius,</hi> a <hi>Scotchman,</hi> whom he took along with him: And having taking his place as the Kings <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anno</hi> 1537.</note> Vicegerent, at the upper end of the Table, he made <note place="margin">A Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> an Oration to them, wherein in the Kings name he thanked them for their ready, and cheerful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:117874:173"/> together, told them that the King desired that they should debate about the present controversies of Religion, for that he would suffer no alteration but by the advice, and consent of them, and his Parliament: <hi>Therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>he desires you for Christs sake, that all malice, obstinacy, and carnal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects being set apart, you will friendly and lovingly dispute amongst your selves of the controversies mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Church, and that you will conclude all</hi>

In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation many points were debated, wherein <hi>Alesius,</hi> being a godly, and learned man, did the Church good service, and so through <hi>Cromwels</hi> industry, though Religion could not be wholly reformed, yet the Reformation of it was well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at that time through all <hi>England.</hi> And this <note place="margin">His zeal.</note> good Lord was alwayes very studious how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Cause of Christ: His whole life was nothing else but a continual care and travel to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the true knowledge of the Gospel, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the House of God: He caused all the people through the Kingdom to be instructed in the Lords Prayer, and Creed, in <hi>English:</hi> Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <note place="margin">Scriptures translated.</note> the Scriptures to be translated, and published
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:117874:173"/> for every <hi>English</hi> man to understand: Then he rescued the vulgar sort from damnable Idolatry, causing many of their grossest Pilgrimages to be destroyed: He procured, that divers idle Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes should be abolished: That Liberty should be given to eat Eggs, and white-meats in Lent: By him it was provided, that for the better instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, Beneficed men should be resident on their Cures to teach, and keep hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Infinite almost were the private benefits which he did in helping poor godly men, and <note place="margin">Mercy to the persecuted.</note> women out of trouble, and great distresses: Yea, his whole life was full of such examples, being a man ordained of God to do many good, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deliver such as were in danger of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Religion sake. Some examples are set down by Master <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of <hi>Martyrs, Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 507. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:117874:174"/> whether he was not somewhat indebted unto her, she said yea, but she durst never call upon him for it, though now she stood in great need of it: He therefore presently sent her to his House with one of his men, and when he came from the Court, he did not onely discharge his debt, but gave her an yearly Pension of four pound, and a Livery eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year so long as she lived after.</p>

                        <hi>Cromwel</hi> went with the <hi>French</hi> Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> the Army being overthrown, he fell into much want, and being in the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> he met a rich Merchant, called <hi>Francis Frescobalds,</hi> and asked of him an Alms for Gods sake; the Merchant under his tottered attire, seeing an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous countenance, moved with pitty, demanded of what Countrey he was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>I am Sir of</hi> England, <hi>my name is</hi> Thomas Cromwel, <hi>my Father was a sheerer of cloth, and I straying from mine own Country, came with the</hi> French <hi>Army into Italy, by whose overthrow I am faln into this want:</hi> The Merchant considering the state of the young man, and loving the <hi>English</hi> Nation, amongst whom he had formerly lived, and from whom he had received many courtesies, took him into his house, entertained him kindely, and when he was desirous to return into his own Countrey, he gave him an horse, a new sute of apparrel, and other necessaries, and sixteen Ducats of gold to bear the charges of his journey. It so fell out after, that at what time the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> was so highly in favour with his Prince, and advanced to so

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:117874:175"/> wherein my authority may prevail to supply your lack and necessity: and so taking him by the hand, he led him into his Chamber, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all to depart, he opened a Chest, and first gave him sixteen Ducats which he had given him in mony, then ten Ducats that he disbursed on his apparrel, and ten other that he paid for his horse: and further, said he, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of your mony, take these four bags, in each of which is four hundred Ducats, these you shall receive from the hand of your assured friend: <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scobald,</hi> though brought to a low ebb, yet expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the vertue of a modest mind, would have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the kindness offered, but that the other enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him against his will to receive it.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:117874:176"/> Also at another time, being with other Lords at the Monastery of <hi>Sheen,</hi> examining some Monks that denied the Kings Supremacy, as he sate at Dinner, he spied afar off a certain poor man, <note place="margin">Another example of gratitude.</note> that used to sweep their Cels and Cloisters, and to ring the Bell, &amp;c. whom when the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> had well noted, he called him to him, and before all the Table, took him by the hand, asked him kindly how he did, and turning to the Lords, said; My Lords, See you this poor man, this mans Father was a great friend to me in my necessity, and hath given me many a meals meat. Then said he to the poor man, Come unto me, and I will so provide for thee, that thou shalt not lack whilest I live: Thus this Worthy and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord excelled in divers eminent vertues, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a flourishing authority, excellent wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and fervent zeal to Christ, and his Gospel: His great care was to preserve, and nourish peace abroad in forreign Realms.

                        </gap>ss also in keeping all things in good order at home: hampering the Popish Prelates,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117874:176"/> and disapointing their subtile devises: then in bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling other unruly persons, forcing them to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by the Laws: He was a succour, and refuge to all godly persons: a terrour to evill doers, so that the very report that <hi>Cromwell</hi> was coming, <note place="margin">He was a terrour to the wicked.</note> quieted many fraies, and much evill rule: A company of Ruffians appointing to fight in <hi>Pater Noster</hi> row, and having blocked up the ends of the street with Cars, that none should intertupt them, <hi>Cromwell</hi> hearing of it, in the heat of the fight came down <hi>Pannier</hi> Alley towards them, but so soon as the report of <hi>Cromwels</hi> coming was heard, the Cars could not keep them in, but thy ran away, and so the fray was ended.</p>
                     <p>Also there was a <hi>Ruffianly</hi> serving man, who to put himself into the gallanter Garb, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nourished his hair till it hung down upon his shoulders: on a time the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> met <note place="margin">Long hair punished.</note> this fellow as he walked in the streets, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his disguised habit, which he judged might be of bad example unto others, he called him to him, and enquired whose man he was, and with all asking him whether his Master, or any of his fellows wore their hair so long, or no: he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no, but to excuse himself, he pleaded that he had made a vow not to cut his hair for such a time: to whom the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> answered, that since he had made himself a Votary, he would not force him to break his vow, but yet he would lay him in prison till the time was expired, and so presently sent him to the Marshal-sey, till his Master having perswaded him to cut his hair, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117874:177"/> for his release, and so being brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> with his short hair, he dismissed him: Also a Frier wearing his Cowle after the dissolution of Monasteries, <hi>Cromwell</hi> meeting him in <hi>Pauls</hi> Churchyard, said to him, will not this Coule of yours be left off yet: If I do not hear by one a clock that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell of thine is changed, thou shalt be hanged immediately for example to all others, and so he durst never wear his Coule after: Innumerable were the benefits which this worthy Lord did, by his prudent Policy, grave authority, and godly zeal for the good both of the Church, and State: what good orders he established, what wickedness he suppressed, what corruptions he reformed, what abuses he discovered, what crafty juglings, and superstitious delusions he detected, and abolished <note place="margin">Idolatrous juglings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and destroyed.</note> out of the Church: as the Roode of Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man stood inclosed with an hundred wyers, wherewith he made the Image roll his eies, nod his head, hang the lip, move, and shake his jaws, according as the value of the gift offered, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or displeased the Priest: if it were a small piece of silver, he would hang the lip, if it were a good piece of gold, his chaps should go merrily, &amp;c.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117874:178"/> the Bible was printed, he would have at least six of them to set up in severall places in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church: Afterwards by the procurement of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the Bible of <hi>Tindals</hi> translation was printed at <hi>London,</hi> one of which he presented to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and obtained that the same might be freely read of all his Subjects: But the setting forth hereof did exceedingly incense the Popish Bishops, especially because of the Prologues to the books, and a large table in the end of it, wherein were set down texts about the Lords supper, and to prove the lawfulness of Ministers mariage, and against the Mass: But whilst <hi>Cromwell</hi> was thus labouring for the publick good, and endeavouring to deliver the poor Saints out of their troubles, the malice of these Popish Bishops encreased so against <note place="margin">Popish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> him, that they continually laboured by false traines, and crafty surmises to cast him out of the Kings favour: About this time, there was one <hi>Iohn Lambert,</hi> a godly, and learned Minister, called in question for his Religion, the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self sat amongst the Bishops, whilst he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and after a long disputation betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and him, in the close of the day, the King said to him: what saist thou now after all this pains that hath been taken with thee, wilt thou live or dy? Thou hast yet free choise: To whom <hi>Lambert</hi> answered, I wholly submit my self to the will of your Ma<seg rend="sup">ty</seg>: the King replied, if you submit your self to me, you must dy, for I will be no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone to Hereticks; and so (by the secret, and crafty counsell of <hi>Stephen Gardiner)</hi> turning himself

                     <p>But when the day came wherein <hi>Lambert</hi> was <note place="margin">Repentance.</note> to be burned, <hi>Cromwell</hi> sent for him into his house, and taking him into his secret Chamber, he asked him forgiveness for that which he had done. The subtile malicious Prelates ceased not, by themselves, and their agents about the King, to calumniate, and traduce him, insomuch that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament being summoned, <hi>Anno</hi> 1541. <hi>Cromwell</hi> being in the Councell-Chamber, was suddenly apprehended, and committed prisoner to the Tower, which was much lamented by all good men, who praied heartily for him: but the Popish party much rejoyced, especially the Clergy, whom he could not abide for their Popery, and masked hypocrisie: Shortly after he was attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Parliament: the crimes which they laid to his Charge were these: First he was accused of <note place="margin">Grievous crimes laid to his charge.</note> Heresie, and for a supporter of such persons, as <hi>Barns, Clark,</hi> and many others, whom by his Authority, and Letters written to the Sheriffs, and Justices in divers Shires, he had rescued out of the hands of their adversaries, and discharged out of Prison: Then, that he had dispersed amongst the Kings Subjects many Books, containing much heresie in them: Then that he had caused to be translated into <hi>English</hi> many Books, comprising matter against the Sacrament of the Altar, &amp; that he had commended it as good and Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;

But the truth was, the King was a weary of his <hi>Queen,</hi> the Lady <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> a vertuous and religious woman, to whom he had been married but a few months, and cast his wanton affections upon the Lady <hi>Katherine Howard,</hi> which <hi>Cromwel</hi> laboured to disswade him from, and therefore he must be taken out of the way.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117874:179"/> them so discreetly, that they could put no Interogatories to him, either concerning Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall, or Civil affairs, wherein he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ripe, and well furnished with an answer. Amongst the Commissioners, there was one whom the L. <hi>Cromwel</hi> desired to carry from him a Letter to the <hi>King,</hi> which he refused; saying, that he would carry no Letter to the King from a Traitor: then he desired him at least to carry a Message from him to the King, which request he assented to, so it were not against his Allegiance; then the Lord <hi>Cromwel</hi> taking witness of the other Lords what he had promised: you shall (said he) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to the King, and tell him; By that he hath so well tryed and proved you, as I have done, he shall find you as false a man as ever came about him: His enemies durst not bring him to his Answer, nor try him by his Peers, but procured an Act of Attaindure, whereby he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before he was heard: yet the King not long after his death repented this hast, wishing that he had his <hi>Cromwel</hi> alive again: When he came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scaffold on Tower-hill, he spake thus unto the people.</p>

                        <hi>Jane:</hi> This Will was read in the presence of the Counsel, &amp; all the Judges of the Realm, who were required to subscribe unto it, and by the power of the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> most of them were <note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges corrupt.</note> either perswaded, or overawed to do it: only Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> would by no means consent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and withall, he went to the King to know of him the reason why he disinherited his Sisters: the King told him how he was advised to it for the safety of Religion, and that the Lawyers had told him, that he might lawfully do it; and therefore entreated him as he tendered the peace and <note place="margin">Humane frailty.</note> propagation of the Gospel, that he would consent to it: So after much debate, and many perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the facile Arch-Bishop was at last drawn to subscribe it.

                     <p>During this her imprisonment, she made sundry Divine, and heavenly prayers; which she uttered with much affection, faith, and fervency: The <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> morning before she suffered, her husband the Lord <hi>Guilford Dudly,</hi> was carried out to the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <note place="margin">Her husband beheaded.</note> on Tower Hill, where, with prayers, in a most penitent manner, he ended his life, whose body all bloody laid in a Cart, together with the head wrapped in a cloth, was brought to the Chappel within the Tower, even in the sight of this sorrowful Lady, a spectacle more deadly then was the Axe of her death: And now her own part was next to be acted: The Stage of her Tragedy was raised upon the Green within the Tower, upon which she mounted with a chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and looking upon the people, with great constancy, she spake thus unto them: <hi>Good people, I</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>PHilip Sidney,</hi> was Son and Heir to Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> President of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter: a Person of Great parts; and in no mean grace with <hi>Queen Elizabeth:</hi> his Mother was Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and Sister to the Earls of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Leicester,</hi> so that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:117874:188"/> his descent was apparantly Noble of both sides. In his very Childhood there appeared in him such excellent parts, and endowments of nature, that his Father conceiving great hopes of him, was very carefull of his education, so that having soon <note place="margin">His educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> drunk in the principles of learning at home, he was sent to the University, where he profited exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in the knowledge of the Arts, so that after an incredible proficiency in all the species of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he left the Academicall life, for that of the Court, whether he came by the invitation, and instigation of his Uncle the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> at that time a great Favorite of the <hi>Queens:</hi> Fame had before hand blazed abroad his noble accomplishments: He was of a comely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and framed by a naturall propension to Arms, so that he soon attracted the good opinion of all men, and was so highly prized in the good <note place="margin">Beloved of the Queen.</note> opinion of the <hi>Queen,</hi> that she thought the Court wanted a great Ornament, when he was absent from it: Whilest he was at Court, at his spare hours, he composed that incomparable Book for phancie, and language, called his <hi>Arcadia,</hi> when he was but one and twenty years old; the <hi>Queen</hi> thought him so fit for the greatest imployments, that she sent him upon an Embassy to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> which he discharged to his own honor, and her good content; yea, his Fame was so renowned through Christendom, <note place="margin">In Election to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> that he was in election for the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> but our <hi>Queen</hi> refused to further his advancement, not out of emulation, but out of fear to loose the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:117874:189"/> Jewel of her times: He married the daughter, and sole Heir of Sir <hi>Francis Walsingam,</hi> then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, a Lady destinated to the bed of Honor, who after his death was married to the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and after his death to the Earl of St. <hi>Albans:</hi> During his aboad at Court, he became of intimate acquaintance with Sir <hi>Fulk Grevil,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <note place="margin">Friendship.</note> L. <hi>Brook,</hi> who thought himself so much honored by his friendship, that having erected for himself a stately Monument in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church in <hi>Warwick,</hi> He caused to be engraven upon his Tomb: <hi>Fulk Grevil servant to Queen Elizabeth, Counsellor to King James, and friend to Sir Philip Sidney.</hi> The States of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained aid of our <hi>Queen</hi> against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they <note place="margin">He is made Governour of <hi>Flushing.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>GAleacius Caracciolus</hi> was born at <hi>Naples, Anno Christi,</hi> 1517. His Fathers name was <hi>Calanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> descended of the ancient, and Noble Family of the <hi>Caraccioli</hi> of <hi>Capua:</hi> His Mother was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of the noble Family of the <hi>Caraffi,</hi> whose Brother was afterwards Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth. His Father was very carefull of his Education in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117874:191"/> his youth, and then being well known to, and in favour with the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fifth; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him to intertain this his Son into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which the Emperor willingly did, and liked him so well, that shortly after he made him his Gentlem an-sewer; in which place, and office, he demeaned himself so wel, that he woon the favour of the Nobility, and rest of the Court, and grew to be of speciall accompt with the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: and indeed few were to be compared with him for innocency of life, elegancy of manners, sound judgement, and knowledge of many things: His Father also being desirous to continue his name, and advance his house, provided for him a Wife, a Virgin of Noble birth, called <hi>Victoria,</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Nuceria,</hi> with whom he had in Portion 6500. l. his Fathers estate being worth 5000. l. <hi>per annum.</hi> By this Wife he had six children [four Sons, and two Daughters] But God intending to advance him to an higher dignity then that to which he was born, was pleased in mercy by degrees to reveal himself, &amp; his truth to him: The first beginning of it was this: There lived about this time in <hi>Naples,</hi> a Noble Spaniard, called <hi>Iohn Waldesius,</hi> who having got some knowledge of the truth of the Gospel, especially in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">Light ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> of Justification, he used often to confer with, and instruct divers other Noble-men, his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and familiar friends, in points of Religion, confuting the false opinion of our inherent Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and merit of good Works, and thereby detecting the vanity and fondness of some Popish
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:117874:192"/> points, by which means (the Lord blessing his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) many of these Noblemen began to creep out of darkness, and to discern the truth, amongst whom one was <hi>Iohn Francis Caesarta,</hi> a Kinsman to <hi>Galeacius:</hi> he discoursing often with <hi>Galeacius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to convince him of the vanity of worldly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges: of the true means of our Justification; of the excellency and power of Gods Word, and of the folly of most of the Popish superstitions: Now <hi>Galeacius</hi> much esteemed this his Kinsman, yet the world hung so heavy upon him, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent these things seemed to make but smal impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon his spirit: At this time <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was a publike Preacher, and Reader at <hi>Naples,</hi> whose holy life, and sweet, copious Teaching, made him very famous. Hereupon, <hi>Galeacius</hi> was once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at <hi>Caesarta's</hi> motion, to go and hear his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet not so much out of a desire to learn, as tickled with a curious humor to hear so famous and learned a man. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> at this time was <note place="margin">Benefit of hearing the word.</note> shewing out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> the weakness, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the judgement of mans reason in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things, and the power, and efficacie of Gods word in those men in whom the Lord works by his Spirit, which he illustrated by this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</p>
                     <p>If a man should see men and women dancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether afar off, and hear no instrument, he would judge them mad, or foolish; but if he come neer, and hear the Musick, and mark their measures, &amp;c. he will then not onely delight to see them, but feel a desire in himself to bear them company: Even so
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:117874:192"/> many men, when they behold in others a sudden and great change of their looks, apparel, beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and whole course of life, at first he will impute it to melancholy, or some foolish hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; but if he look neerer, and begin to hear, and perceive the sweet harmony and consent of Gods Spirit, and word in them, then they change their opinion, and begin, first, to like them, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in them; and afterwards feel in themselves a desire to imitate, and be of the number of such men, as forsaking the worlds vanity, walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of the Gospel, that they may come to true, and sound sanctification: This comparison, by the grace, power, and efficacie of Gods Spirit, wrought wonderfully in <hi>Galeacius,</hi> (as he oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest <note place="margin">His conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> to his friends) that from that hour he resolved to forsake his former pleasures, and practices, and to set himself to seek out true happiness: and for that end, he read the Scriptures every day, as the fountain whence it must be drawn, and wherein the way to heaven was discovered: He chose such company, by whose life and conference he might be edified in the true Religion, and in his most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith: But this great alteration being observed in <hi>Naples,</hi> his old companions were much amazed at it: some judged it a melancholy passion: others esteemed it plain folly, &amp; feared that he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come simple, and doting. But such as feared God, as they wondred much to see so great a change in so great a man; so they exceedingly rejoyced to see it, and praised the Lord in his behalf: But the more couragiously this worthy servant of Christ
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:117874:193"/> went on in the ways of godliness, the more the Devil raged against him by his temptations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring thereby to stop his course, or, if it were possible to drive him back again, that <hi>having</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Satans malice.</note>
                        <hi>begun in the spirit, he might end in the flesh:</hi> First, his zealous profession procured him an infinite number of mocks, and made him the subject of most vile slanders: many took occasion thereby extreamly to hate him: his Father was much displeased and vext, seeing how the honor and advancement of his house was like to be ecclipsed thereby, and therefore he often, and sharply chid him, charged <note place="margin">Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> him with his Fatherly authority to put away his melancholy conceits: this much grieved him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always very submiss, and obedient to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: his Wife <hi>Victoria</hi> also (though a wise, kind, and dutifull Wife) yet would she by no means yield to his motion, for the change of her religion, fearing infamy, and reproach thereby, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she was always soliciting of him with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, tears, kind intreaties, and all other ways that a wife could use to her husband: It was also a great temptation, that almost all the Nobility in and about <hi>Naples,</hi> being of kin, and familiar acquaintance with him, oft resorted to him, to draw him forth to his old sports and pleasures: And his Office sometimes calling him to the Court, it was a great trouble to him, for there he heard of any thing rather then of Religion; not a word of Gods word, but all of pleasures, honors, &amp;c. or how they might rid out of the way the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakers of Popery, and professors of the true faith:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:117874:193"/> yet Satan set upon him by a more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous temptation, to withdraw him from the truth; for at that time <hi>Italy</hi> was much pestered with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who with glorious shews deceived the simple; these men set upon <hi>Galeacius,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tentations from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note> seeking by all means to entangle him in their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and blasphemous phancies: But Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness appeared wonderfully, enabling him, newly entred into the School of Christian Religion, and as yet little studied in the Scriptures, to resist the cunning snares of these dissembling Hereticks, many of them being grounded Scholers, and throughly studied in the Scriptures: yet he by the sincere simplicity of Gods truth, and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Holy Ghost, not onely discerned the fondness of their opinions, but untied the knots, and brake the snares, and mightily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed them: yea, (through Gods mercy) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often in their meetings, he was strongly confirmed in the truth by hearing, and seeing of them: Yet he met with a more dangerous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for the <hi>Waldesians,</hi> with whom he most conversed, though they were right in some points of Religion about Justification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and disliked some abuses in Popery, yet they frequented the Popish Churches, heard their Masses, &amp; were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at their vile Idolatries, and this they did to avoid persecution, and this was a dangerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to <hi>Galeacius,</hi> but (through the good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God) his Office calling him into <hi>Germany</hi> to the Emperors Court, at <hi>Strasbrough</hi> he met with his old friend <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> (who was then
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:117874:194"/> Divinity Professor there) by whom he learned, that the knowledge of the truth of Justification was not sufficient to salvation, if in the mean time a man defiled himself with Idolatry, which the Scripture cals spiritual whoredom: from him he received many other comfortable instructions, and thereby was much confirmed in the truth: and so returning to <hi>Naples,</hi> he declared his Judgement to the <hi>Waldesians,</hi> concerning the shunning of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whereupon they presently forsook him, being unwilling to hear of that Doctrine which would expose them to all maner of sufferings: But God of his infinite mercy, wrought in him such heroical <note place="margin">Christian courage.</note> resolutions, that seeing his friends forsook him, and he had no hope of seeing a Reformation in <hi>Naples,</hi> he resolved to forsake his Country, and seek for Christ and his Religion wheresoever he might find them, and that he would rather forsake father, wife, children, goods, honors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to win Christ, then to enjoy them all, and want Christ Jesus; yet herein he met with many grievous combats: for so oft as he looked upon his aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Tentations many.</note> that dearly loved him, and whom he again respected with all duty, and reverence, so oft he was stricken to the heart with unspeakable grief to think of leaving of him; and such like reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings he had in his heart: What, must I needs forsake my loving father, or else I cannot have God my Father? And must I needs fail in my duty to him, if I perform my duty to God? Shall I hereby bring his hoary hairs with sorrow to the grave? Shall I bring an obloquie upon him, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117874:194"/> my whole kindred? shall I be the cause of his death, that would (if need were) redeem my life with his own death? Yet must I rather hazard his life, then cast my own poor soul with horror into hell: And no less was he grieved in respect of his noble Wife, having no hope that she would renounce Popery, and go with him: She was in the prime of her youth, a Lady of great birth, fair, wise, and modest, but her love and loialty to him passed all, which filled him with these reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: Shall I thus suddenly leave my dear wife, the onely joy of my heart in this world, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, the augmenter of my joy, and lesner of my wo? Shall I thus leave her for ever? Shall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my self of her, &amp; thereby of all others also, and of all comfort of a conjugal life, and married estate? Alas poor Lady! what will become of her, and her little ones when I am gone? What will she do but weep, and wail, and pine away with grief? Yet must I for Christs sake resolve to leave her, and all, to follow Christ: Whilst he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated on these things, he thought he heard, and saw his wife sighing, and sobbing, and weeping, and houling, and running after him, saying: Ah my deer Lord! and sweet husband, whither will you go? And will you leave me poor woman comfortless and succourless? What can honors, riches, gold, silver, jewels, friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do when I want you? What joy can I take in my children without you, but rather my grief to be doubled to look on them? How can any be perswaded that you care for me, or them? Is this the love you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:117874:195"/> have so often boasted of? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These thoughts tormented him the more, because they boiled in his heart, and he durst impart them to none, least they should have hindred his departure: yet the thoughts about his children extreamly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his grief: they were goodly and towardly children, worthy such Noble parents: they were young, and therefore not apprehensive what it was to want a Father: He loved them tenderly: When his wife, the Lady, did sometimes put into his arms the youngest to play with, how did it cut him to the heart, and what ado had he to contain from floods of tears? how did he in himself thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and shall I presently leave these sweet Babes to the wide and wicked world, as though they had never been my children? to be a Father is a comfort, but a Father of no children, and yet to have children, is a misery? And you poor Orphans, what will become of you when I am gone? Your hap is hard to be fatherless, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet living: What can your great birth now help you? by my departure you shall loose all, honor, living, dignity, &amp;c. yea, hereby you shall be exposed to infamy, reproach, slander, &amp;c. so that you shall curse the time that ever you had me for your Father: Many other were the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he conflicted withall, though inferiour to these, as leaving the company of so many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, his kindred and acquaintance: to loose his honorable Office at Court: to leave for ever his Native soyl, the fruitfull <hi>Italy:</hi> to deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and posterity of the Noble title of a Marques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:117874:195"/> to undertake a long and tedious journey: to cast himself into exile, povertie, shame, and other miseries: to leave so brave a seat, the Garden and Orchard wherof exceeded all others in <hi>Italy,</hi> to see which, there daily resorted many strangers out of all parts: yet resolved he (through Gods grace) to leave all and follow Christ: saying thus to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: <hi>Thou Lord art he that drewest me out of the mistie darkness of ignorance, enlightning my mind</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Christian courage.</note>
                        <hi>with thy holy spirit, and with the heavenly knowledge of thy truth, thou hast made known to me the way of salvation, &amp; hast ransomed me to thy self, by the blood of thy Son: now therefore holy Father I am only thine, consecrated to thy glory, &amp; therefore I will follow thee, and obey thee, and walk in thy ways whithersoever thou shalt be pleased to call me. Not my Father, Wife, Children, Honors, Lands, Riches, nor all my delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and pleasures shall hold me one hour from following thee: I deny my self, and I deny this whole World for thee, and thy sake: O Lord thou knowest how many enemies compass me? How many hinderances, and temptations lie in my way, &amp;c. O Lord have mercy upon me, and deliver my soul, &amp;c. O blessed and happy these miseries, that pull me out of the worlds vanities, and sink of sins, that I may be made heir of everlasting glory; welcome therefore the Cross of Christ, I will take it up O Lord, and will follow thee.</hi> According to this holy resolution, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his mind known onely to a few of his choice friends, of whose piety he hoped well, he wrought so much upon them, that they vowed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in this his voluntary exile; yet, see the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:117874:196"/> of mans heart, most of these, when they <note place="margin">Apostasie.</note> came to the borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> and began seriously to consider what they left behind them, and what they went to, they first (with <hi>Lots</hi> wife) began to look back, and afterwards went back, turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the vomit of their pleasures: But oh the unsearchableness of Gods judgements, these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull persons refusing so great a mercy offered them, the Lord pursued with just revenge: for purposing to serve God in their pleasures in the <note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Apostates.</note> middest of Popery, they were taken by the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> forced publikely to recant, and abjure their religion, and so became the subject of misery, and infamy, and were equally odious to both parties: Yet their Apostacy was a great discouragement to <hi>Galeacius,</hi> seeing himself forsaken of those by whose society he hoped to have enjoyed much comfort in a strange Country: Notwithstanding all this, he prepared for his departure, and finding his opportunity, he concealed his purpose, least the authority of his Father might have diverted him, and so getting some 1000. Marks, which his Mother had left him, on the 20. of <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1551. &amp; of his Age 34. he departed from <hi>Naples,</hi> as if he had intended for the <hi>Emperors</hi> Court, whither indeed he went, attending his Office for a short time, and then bidding adieu to the Court, and all worldly pleasures, he went strait to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where <note place="margin">He forsakes all for <hi>Christ.</hi>
                        </note> he arrived in safety (through Gods mercy) &amp; with a joyfull heart: In that City, though there was an <hi>Italian Church;</hi> yet met he with none of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, but one, a Nobleman of <hi>Siena,</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:117874:196"/> now a Preacher to the <hi>Italian</hi> Congregation: thus blessing God for freeing of him from the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian <note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> yoak, &amp; bringing of him where he might safely profess his name with a free conscience; he associated himself with Master <hi>Calvin,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his instruction, who finding his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, meekness, &amp;c. most kindly entertained him into his fellowship, and this their mutuall love was so firmly grounded, that it continued to their <note place="margin">Friendship.</note> lives end; Master <hi>Calvin</hi> shews how he honored &amp; esteemed of him by his Epistle to him, wherein he dedicates to him his <hi>Commentary</hi> upon the first Epist. to the <hi>Corin.</hi> And amongst many other high commendations that he gives him there, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that the example of <hi>Galeacius</hi> prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led much with him, for the strengthning of his <note place="margin">Benefit of good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> faith, and encrease of his godliness: But when the news of his fixing at <hi>Geneva</hi> came to the Emperors Court, and to <hi>Naples,</hi> it cannot be imagined how strangely it affected all that heard it: but above all, his own friends were wonderfully astonished at it, and his Family; where nothing was to be heard but lamentations, tears, and pitiful complaints, so that it seemed a lively pattern of woe, and misery: yet was the old Marquess his Father most affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of all others, foreseeing hereby the ruin and downfall of his estate and Family: but the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of sorrow being once over, he began to cast about by what means he might recover him again; and for that end sent a cosen-german of his, that was most dear to <hi>Galeacius,</hi> with Lttters to <note place="margin">New tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note>
                        <hi>Geneva,</hi> full of authority, protestations, bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:117874:197"/> and loving intreaties to return home again, for the comfort of his aged Father, the reviving, and cheering up his forlorn wife, and distressed children, and to the unspeakable joy of all his kindred. This Gentleman coming to <hi>Geneva,</hi> found <hi>Galeacius</hi> in a mean house, which he had taken for his use, with onely two servants attending upon him: but how sad was the meeting of these two gentlemen, which was spent in nothing but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, sighs, sobs, and tears; yea, it so exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that for divers hours, they could not speak a word each to other: till at last the Gentleman ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and longing to recover his friend, with piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words mixed with tears, he delivered his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, til he had recovered more freedom of speech, which having once obtained, to his Letters, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded obtestations, intreaties, perswasions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, all mingled with many tears, that he would respect the ruin of his house, the grief of his old Father, the desperate condition of his Wife, and Children, &amp;c. and remedy all by his return into <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>Galeacius,</hi> being as unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">Tentations resisted.</note> as a Rock, without delay returned him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he knew all this which he said to be true, yet withall he would have him know, that he had done nothing rashly, he had consulted with God, by whose grace he was moved hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: and by the same grace had his eyes opened to discern the truth, and to see the Superstitions in Popery, &amp;c.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:117874:197"/> one of these must needs be chosen, either to stay at home with a burthened conscience, under an heap of errors, and superstitions, or else to leave house, lands, family, Country; yea, and all the worlds glory, thereby to obtain liberty to serve the Lord purely according to his word; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he resolved of two evils to chuse the less, and rather to shut his eyes against the splendor of worldly glory, and empty vanities, then that the sight of them should hinder him from following <note place="margin">Constancy.</note> the call of Christ; who saith, That he is unworthy to be his Disciple, who leaveth not Father, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Wife, Children, &amp;c. yea, and his own life to follow him: therefore said he, I forsook all these, because I could not enjoy Christ, and them, being heartily sorry that they would not come to him, or that he might not have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty safely to live with them: But for himself, he said he had riches, honor, and joy enough, so long as in that cottage with his two servants, he might live in the true Church of God, enjoy his Word and Sacraments free from pollution, and the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of godly men, and have time to converse with God by holy meditation, &amp; to confer with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious friends about Gods great goodness shewed him in his conversion, &amp;c. His kinsman was much astonished at this answer, yet had nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; considering that his resolution was not grounded on carnall reason, or the will of man, but upon the holy word of God, and his powerful and unresistable calling: therefore with a sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart he held his tongue, bitterly complaining
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:117874:198"/> within himself, that he had succeeded no better, and so after a while he took his leave of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved friend, with many tears, and pitifull cries on both sides. When he came neer <hi>Naples,</hi> there was much running to hear good news, but when he had delivered his heavie message, the sorrow of them all was redoubled upon them: Father, Wife, Children, Friends, &amp;c. were all overwhelmed with grief: and the rather, because at the same time the Emperor had published an Edict, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he proclaimed <hi>Galeacius</hi> guilty of high-treason, confiscating his goods, and making himself, and his posterity uncapable of his Fathers Marques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: this made the old man, notwithstanding his great age, to go to the Emperor, and to sue to him, that his sons falling from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church might not prejudice his posterity, but that himself only might bear the punishment of his fault: But before he entred upon this journy, he dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away a messenger with a letter, to charge his son upon his filiall odedience, to meet him such a time <note place="margin">His Father sends for him.</note> at <hi>Verona,</hi> within the <hi>Venetian</hi> territories, hoping if he could speak with him, that he should recal him from the society of the Hereticks of <hi>Geneva: Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> having received this Letter, and taken advice upon it, purposed not to disobey so lawful a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Father, though he feared that it would but further exasperate him: yet, before he went, he resolved by Gods grace, that neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, intreaties, allurements, &amp;c. should stir him one inch from that course of Religion, whereby he had begun to serve the Lord: And thus armed
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117874:198"/> with heavenly fortitude, and the Prayers of the Church, he hasted to <hi>Verona,</hi> where he found his Father, who received, and used him kindly: and after salutations, he set upon him with all the <note place="margin">They meet.</note> cunning and subtile arguments that he could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly invent to draw him home again: <hi>Galeacius</hi> humbly answers, that his body and estate is his Fathers, but his conscience is the Lords: tels him he cannot imbrace that motion, but he must make Shipwrack of a good conscience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly intreats him, that seeing his only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire was to obey God, and save his soul, that he would not urge him more to respect estate, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, then Gods glory, and his own souls health: The old Marquess seeing the unmoveableness of his son, which he deemed wilfulness; yet enjoyned him at least to stay there till he had been with the Emperor, and preferred his Petition to him: this <hi>Galeacius</hi> assented to, and performed; but so soon as ever he understood that the Emperor had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Fathers request, he with a joyfull heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and being there, he considered <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> how to imploy himself for the publike good: for which end he devised how to settle the Discipline of the <hi>Italian</hi> Church there, which was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by a confluence of families w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> fled from the bloody Inquisition: About this time <hi>Calvin</hi> was delegated to go to <hi>Basil</hi> about matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with whom (at his request) <hi>Galiaceus</hi> went, and there met with <hi>Celsus,</hi> descended of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family of the Earls of <hi>Martinengo</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> lately (through Gods mercy) escaped out of the

                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1555. His Uncle <hi>Paulus Quintus</hi> was made Pope; hereupon the old Marquess wrote to him, commanding him to meet him at <hi>Mantua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Father sends again for him.</note> sending him provision of mony for his journey: he obeyed, and went thither, where his Father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him with more then ordinary kindness. Then he told him, that he had procured of his Uncle, the Pope, a Dispensation for him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might freely live in any City within the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Territories, without being molested for his Religion and Conscience: He told him that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would be a greater solace to his old age, <note place="margin">Great tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> then his absence had been a grief, earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating him that he would gratifie him in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and all in a most pathetical maner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him not to reject so great a favour offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by the Pope, telling him that hereby he might recover his honors, estate, friends, and estimation. <hi>Galeacius</hi> was wonderfully perplexed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:117874:199"/> with this motion, considering the proffers, and promises, and authority of his Father, which he knew not well how to deny, nor how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, the rather because he wanted the advise of his faithful friend Master <hi>Calvin:</hi> Being in this great perplexity, he durst not rely upon his own wit, but retiring himself, betook himself to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer unto God his Saviour, the Author of true Wisdom, humbly craving the assistance of his holy Spirit, that in this his extremity he might <note place="margin">Prayer for wisdom and councel.</note> resolve upon that which was most for Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and his own sound comfort: And the Lord answered his prayers, directing him in the way that he should chuse: For considering, that the Pope, Antichrist like, directly opposed himself to Christ, his religion, and true Church, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he might by no means sue for, or accept any <note place="margin">Rerurn of Prayers</note> favour at his hands, nor be at all beholding to him for any thing: Besides, Gods Spirit suggested to him, that it carried with it a shew of Apostasie, to forsake the fellowship of Christs Church, and to live amongst Idolaters: as also how scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous it would be to professors, who would be ready to think, that he had taken his farewell of religion, and renewed acquaintance with his old friend the world: and further, that this was to forsake the ordinary means of the true word, and Sacraments, and to live in a place where there was nothing but Idolatry: He further saw that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans policy herein was to entangle him again in the cares of the world, and pleasures of <hi>Italy,</hi> and thereby to dazie his eyes with sensual delights,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117874:200"/> that by degrees the power of godliness might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in him: &amp; lastly, Gods holy Spirit taught him wisdom how to answer all his Fathers objections, and confute all his arguments: Hereupon he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeched his Father not to draw him to that which afterwards he might have cause to repent of, by making him a prey to the Papists, who held it for a <hi>Maxime, that faith was not to be kept with Hereticks:</hi> therefore saith he, its better for me, and more joy to you, that I live in this poor estate, then that I should endanger my life, and my whole posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the Marquess being silenced hereby, returned with an heavy heart to <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Galeacius</hi> with a merry heart to <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he was received by <note place="margin">He goes back to <hi>Geneva.</hi>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:117874:201"/> had discovered his constant resolution to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in his Religion, and that he would rather die <note place="margin">Constancy.</note> then be drawn from it: yet in the midst of these mournings, which almost brake his heart, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himself in the Lord, dealing with his wife in a loving way, and earnest manner to go and live with him her Husband, as the Law of God, and nature required, promising her that she should have liberty of her religion, to live as she would: but she flatly answered him [though with <note place="margin">His Wifes unkindness.</note> many tears] that she would never go with him to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and that she would not live with him as long as he was intangled with those Heresies: Yea, so violent and wilfull she was, that she there deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that duty which a wife is bound by all Law to yield to her husband, nor would by any means lye with him as man and wife; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that she was expresly forbidden by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor to do it, upon the pain of excommunication: How this unwomanly answer pierced his heart, its easie for Husbands to guess: yet he bore it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <note place="margin">His pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> constancy and quietness of mind, but withall told her, that if she denied him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall duty which by the Law of God she owed him, he would sue out a divorce against her: Notwithstanding she still persisted in her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy, rather chusing to break Gods command, then her Confessors: he therefore resolving to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, reiterated his former protestation to her, and so bad her to take it as his last warning.</p>
                     <p>The dolefull day of his departure being come, <note place="margin">Tentations at his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> he went to his Father to take his leave, whose for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:117874:201"/> love was now turned into fury, so that he gave him his farewell with many an heavie and bitter curse, which the Lord turned into blessing, and so having passed this brunt, he came into the Hall, where was his Wife, Children, and many of his neer kindred, and deer friends, all fraught with grief and heaviness: Nothing was heard but sighs, sobs, and cries: Nothing seen but tears, and wringing of hands, his Wife imbracing, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him about the neck, beseeched him with lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and pitifull speeches, that he would pity himself, her, and his children, and not so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cast them all away: His young children all upon their knees, with arms stretched out, hands holden up, and faces swoln with tears, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him to have pity upon them, his own bowels, and not to make them fatherless before their time: His kindred with heavie countenances, and watry eyes looked rufully on him, and though through grief they could not speak, yet every look and gesture was a loud cry, and strong intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for his stay amongst them: unutterable was the grief of them all, &amp; unspeakable was the torment, and temptation that he felt in this agony, when he must either leave <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> or these his friends for his sake: Yet above all, there was one most lamentable sight, which would have broke an heart of Flint: amongst all his children he had one daughter of tvvelve years old, a proper and towardly Gentlewoman, who catching fast hold about his knees, held him so hard, that he could by no means shake her off, and fatherly affections
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:117874:202"/> would not suffer him to hurt her: he laboured to be loose, but she held fast; he went forwards, but she trailed after, erying to him, not to be so cruel to her his child, who came into the world by him: this so wonderfully affected him, being a man of a most loving and tender-hearted nature, that as he oft related, that it made his very bowels to rowl within him, and that his heart was ready presently to burst in sunder: But being armed with a Divine, and supernatural fortitude, he brake <note place="margin">Tentations overcome.</note> thorow all these temptations, and trod under foot whatsoever might hinder him from Christ, and so leaving that heavie house, and dolorous company, he hastened to the Sea-side, and taking ship, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently caused them to hoise sails towards <hi>Laesina,</hi> yet with a toiled, and distressed mind, betwixt sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when he remembred whom he had for ever left behind, and joy to remember that he had escaped: Yet could he not so master naturall affections, but that he brake out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears, and often looked back to that which he had left behind, yet saw that he must leave all for Christs sake: but it much pierced his heart, when in looking back, he saw his Wife, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and kindred standing on the shore, who when their cries could be heard no longer, ceased not to look after the ship so long as it was in sight, neither could he refrain, but with a wofull countenance looked at them again, so long as he could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them: and remembring all the former pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of his Fathers curses, his Wifes tears, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens cries, &amp;c. it fetched from him many a heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:117874:202"/> sigh, and bitter groan: Yet the sprirituall strength, and courage of his mind was constant, and invincible: So that after a while, he cheered up himself, and bended the <note place="margin">Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> knees of his heart to the eternall father in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, giving him most hearty thanks, for that he had furnished him with such a portion of grace, as to withstand, and conquer Sathan in so perilous a conflict; and for delivering him from Popish thraldom, and the bloody Inquisition, which he <note place="margin">Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him.</note> was in continual danger of whilst he was in <hi>Italy:</hi> He praised God also for giving him time, oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and grace to perform that Duty to his wife, which he had omitted at his first departure from her: As also that he had made that prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station to her, upon her monstrous and undutiful behaviour towards him: And so (through Gods goodness) he came safely to <hi>Geneva, October</hi> 4. <note place="margin">He returns to <hi>Geneva.</hi>

His safe arrival brought exceeding joy to the whole Church there, especially to the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Congregation; amongst whom he lived with unspeakable contentment in his own conscience, in his former private, and quiet life: And after a few years, he began to finde in himself some <note place="margin">He intended a second ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> reasons which inclined him to think of entering into a married condition; and the rather, because he never heard from his wife, nor found any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting in her, nor remorse for her former obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy: This his purpose he communicated to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Calvin,</hi> craving his advise and councel in a case of so great importance: His answer was, that it was most convenient, and less scandalous, if he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:117874:203"/> could abstain from mariage: <hi>Galeacius</hi> told him that he could not abstain, and gave him many <note place="margin">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117874:203"/> by Scripture, Fathers, Councels, and by the Civil Law, which being returned to <hi>Galeacius,</hi> he still taking the consent of the Church along with him, sued out a Divorce, and had it legally by <note place="margin">He is divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> the Magistrate granted unto him: After which, advising with his godly, and prudent friends, he began to think of disposing himself in marriage, wherein yet he sought not so much after riches, beauty, birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as for a fit companion of his life, with whom he might comfortably spend the remainder of his days, and serve God cheerfully till the coming of his Lord and Master: And the Providence of God (which never fails his children that wait and depend upon him) provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him such a wife as his heart desired, <hi>viz.</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronly Genlewoman, a Widow that came from <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Geneva,</hi> for true Religions sake: She was well reported of for piety, modesty, and many excellent qualities, and about forty years of age: <hi>Galeacius</hi> considering her fitness in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, <note place="margin">He marries again.</note> married her, <hi>Anno</hi> 1560. and of his age for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three, and they lived together many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with much comfort, and excellent agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so that the great afflictions, and unquietness of his former life was now fully recompenced with a life full of all contentment, and Christian joy.</p>
                     <p>His next care was to unburthen himself of all worldly cares, prescribing to himself a moderate, and frugal course of life: Kept onely two maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants, <note place="margin">His frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> lived in great sobriety, yet always free from sordid baseness, neither wanting necessaries,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117874:204"/> nor having superfluities: His attire was plain, but comely: &amp; he that might in his own country have been attended with many servants, did often walk the streets alone, not having one man with him: Yea, he disdained not oft to go into the Market, and provide his own necessaries, and sometimes would buy, and carry home Fruits, Hearbs, <note place="margin">Humility.</note> Roots, and such other things: esteeming this course of life, together with freedom of Religion, better then the Marquesdom of <hi>Vicum:</hi> Yet under this mean attire was shrowded that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, majesty, and deportment, that any wise ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server might easily discern that he came of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble race: He was a great ornament to, and was highly esteemed and honored by all the City of <hi>Geneva,</hi> every one speaking of his praise, so that it was hard to say, whether he was more beloved, or admired amongst the Magistrates, Ministers, and persons of all ranks: No publike meeting was <note place="margin">God highly honors him.</note> appointed, or solemn feast made, unto which he was not invited, every one thinking himself happy that might enjoy his company: and (though he would have refused it) yet every one gave him the title of a Marquess all his life long: His noble qualities were such, that every one honored him: Strangers, Princes and Noblemen that visited <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva</hi> would by no means omit to see, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Galeacius,</hi> honoring him no less then if he had been in <hi>Naples.</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:117874:205"/> Gods glory, and the edification of his Church: But after a long calm of peace and tranquility, God raised up new storms, yet further to try his patience, and exercise his graces: for first he fell <note place="margin">He sickens.</note> sick of a grievous, and doubtfull disease, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from abundance of rheume, which made him so short winded, that he could hardly draw his breath, wherewith he was exceedingly tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted night and day, so that he could scarce get any sleep: this was procured by his long and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som journeys, which he had formerly taken by Sea, and by Land, for his conscience sake: Then there came to <hi>Geneva</hi> a Nephew of his, bringing him Letters from his former Wife, and his eldest <note place="margin">A new ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> Son, perswading him yet at length to return to his Native Country, and former Religion: giving him hope that hereby he might advance his youngest son to the place of a Cardinal, &amp;c. But the soul of this worthy Gentleman was much wounded, and grieved hereat, as abhorring those <note place="margin">His zeal.</note> profane dignities in the Popish Church, and to shew his distaste of the motion, he burnt the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the Messengers face, and withall not daigning to answer them by writing, he by word of mouth returned a grave, wise, and zealous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: Yet this importunate Jesuite (for so he was) ceased not to molest him with frivilous reasons, and fleshly arguments, promising him an huge sum of mony, if he would return home, &amp;c. But the Noble and holy heart of this godly Christian, in an heavenly zeal, and ardent love to his Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> could not but shew it
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:117874:205"/> self, which made him to cry out: <hi>Let their mony</hi>

But know, that my Lord and Saviour hath made me enamoured of far more precious jewels, and durable riches:</hi> Which words so enraged this Papist, that he brake out into ill words, and reproachfull terms, and so went his way: Being delivered from this tempter, his sickness encreased more, and more upon him: his pain was most grievous, but he <note place="margin">His Faith &amp; Patience.</note> bare it with an heroicall courage, and as the pains encreased, so his faith, and patience encreased, and as the outward man perished, the inward man was renued day by day, and above all, he found unspeakable comfort and sweetness in his prayers to the Lord, and would often say, that in the middest of his prayers his soul seemed to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished, <note place="margin">Joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> and to tast of the blessed joys of Heaven, and as the suffering of Christ abounded in him, so the consolations by Christ abounded much more: The Physicians spared no pains to cure him, nor his friends to visit him, especially his loving and tender wife was never from about him: But all was in vain, the time of his dissolution drawing on; Therefore he wholly sequestred himself from any more care of his body, and from all worldly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations: he took his farewell of his wife, and all his Christian friends, saying, <hi>That he would lead</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>KAtherine Bretterg</hi> was born in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> the Daughter of Master <hi>Iohn Bruen,</hi> of <hi>Bruen-Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleford,:</hi> Her education before her marriage, was such, as became the profession of the Gospel, in godliness, and purity of life, and religion: She was studious of the holy Scriptures from a child, <note place="margin">Scriptures studied.</note> and by reading thereof gained such knowledg, that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:117874:207"/> she was able to make good use of them as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was offered: She used the things of this world moderately, and soberly, not affecting the vain <note place="margin">Modesty. Her Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> pleasures and fashions that others too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in: She used not to gad abroad with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>Dina,</hi> but rather with <hi>Hanah,</hi> she delighted to tread upon the dust of the Sanctuary, and to walk in the ways of <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp;c. The Sabbath day <note place="margin">Sabbaths sanctified.</note> was always dear and welcome to her, and though many times she went far for it, yet she would not be without the Ministery of the Word: And her heart was so tender, and full of compassion, that oftentimes she was perceived to hear Sermons, <note place="margin">A soft heart.</note> read, pray, and meditate, with tears: She made conscience of all, even of the least sin, and such as many accounted no sins: She never used to swear an oath, great or small: Neither at any time brake forth into unseemly speeches, lying in jeast, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest words, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She used not the Name, or Titles of God at any time without great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Her private discourses were always well seasoned, and proceeded from such a sanctified heart, that they ministred grace to the hearers: Her daily exercise was to converse with God, in reading, praying, singing, and meditating: All her delight was in the Saints, and in those that were most excellent: The Lords Precepts were precious to her, for from her childhood she feared God, and walked before him with an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart: She was not like many women, that are unable to render a reason of the Faith, and Hope that is in them, but grew in grace, and in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:117874:207"/> the knowledge of our Lord Jesus: When she was about twenty years old, by her Parents consent, she was married to Master <hi>William Bretterg</hi> of <hi>Bret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terghold</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Her marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> neer <hi>Leverpool,</hi> who was a young Gentleman, that imbraced Religion sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and suffered much for it at the hands of Papists: This gratious couple lived two years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in such mutual joy, and comfort, as well beseemed the children of God: In which time she had one daughter by him: Their Habitation was in the midst of ignorant, and brutish Papists, <note place="margin">Popish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> who were always doing some wrong, and injury to them, yet her knowledge, patience, mildness, and constancy for the Truth, much edified, and built up her husband in his most holy faith, and incouraged him with more patience to bear all the wrongs, and indignities that were daily offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him: He had his horses and cattle divers times killed in the night in his grounds by such malicious Papists as hated him for his Religion sake, which exceedingly conduced to his loss, and hinderance, being most of the stock that he had; <note place="margin">Her pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> yet did she not onely bear this great affliction with admirable patience, but even rejoyced, and praised God, submitting to his holy, and wise Providence: She would often say, It is good that such things should be, but wo be to them that do them: It is good in God, thereby to chasten his children, and prevent some sin that he saw us like to fall into: Its good in respect of Gods Church, that the weak may be confirmed in the Truth, and that Popery may be disgraced, when the world shall
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:117874:208"/> see such wickedness flow from it: Its good in God, that so the wicked may be without excuse in the day of Judgement, when their conscience tels them, that though God suffers them to do such villany, for some just cause known to himself, yet they commit it only of malice, and revenge: And in the middest of such vexatious practises, she would often say: The mercies of God are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, who doth not only by his Word, but by his Justice also make us fit for his Kingdom: Little do our enemies know what good by these things they do unto us, and what ruin they bring to their own Kingdom, while they thus set forth the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness thereof: She used often to pray, That God would forgive them, who had thus wronged them, and send them repentance for it: She used to call upon her Husband to do the like, and to <note place="margin">Her prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give.</note> bless them that cursed him; and lest her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band should fail in this duty, she daily prayed to God to sanctifie her Husbands thoughts, and direct his heart aright, onely to seek Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, without seeking revenge, or satisfying his own affections: So carefull she was to prevent sin, both in her self, and others: Her meekness, humility, and unspotted cariage was such, as that she forced some that were adversaries to her religion, yet to speak well of her: She had a good report of all that knew her, for her holy and sincere life: She was very pitifull, and bountifull to the poor, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting no opportunity of doing good where <note place="margin">Charity.</note> she could: She constantly kept her times of <note place="margin">Piety.</note> Praying, Reading, and Meditating: She would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:117874:208"/> by no means be absent from family duties: She used private duties, not onely in her Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, but abroad in her Garden, Orchard, &amp;c. She tasked her self to the reading of Eight Chapters a day at least, out of the sacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and such time as she saw idly, or evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spent, she used to call, <hi>The time of tentation:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Idleness dangerous.</note> She spent much time also in reading good Books, judicious Expositors, and the Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and was many times so affected in reading of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Christians were put to, &amp;c. that she would weep very bitterly for the same: She was <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> so zealous for Gods glory, and loved the truth so intirely, that she would often argue against Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but never open her mouth to plead for <hi>Baal.</hi> Sin was so hatefull to her, that she would grieve for it, both in her self and others: Once, as she was riding to Church with her Husband, he was angry with his man, whereupon she said to him; Alas Husband, I fear your heart is not right to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, that can be thus angry for a trifle: and weeping, she further, you must pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your passions, and always be sure your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be for God; else how dare you appear this day before his Minister, and offer up your prayers in the publike Congregation before God? And another time a Tenant of her Husbands being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <note place="margin">Mercy.</note> with his rent, she desired him to bear with him a quarter of a year longer; and then when he brought it, with tears she said to her Husband; I fear you do not do well to take it of him, though it be your right, for I doubt he is not well able to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:117874:209"/> pay it, and then you oppress the poor: She was so blamless in her whole course, that the common enemies of Religion, the Papists, had nothing to say against her: and amongst all the godly that knew her, she was highly prized for her modest, holy, and humble carriage: Thus she continued <note place="margin">Her sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> with her Husband about two years, and then it pleased God that she fell sick of a Feaver, which was so violent, that it made her sometimes to talk idlie, and by Satans subtilty, that watches his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, she began to fall into an heavie conflict <note place="margin">Tentation.</note> of Spirit: First she began to find some little infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and weakness of Faith more then ordinary, but through Gods mercy, she soon overcame it: But shortly after Satan assaulted her in a more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner, but after a day or two God delivered her, sending her peace, and comfort of conscience, which encreased more &amp; more in her, to her death: In the beginning of her conflict, the severity of Gods justice, &amp; the greatness of her sins came into her mind, which much afflicted her, wherof she of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complained: then she accused her self of pride, that she had delighted in her self, and her beauty too much: then she thought that she had no faith, but was an hypocrite, and one that had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Religion so sincerely, nor glorifyed God so carefully, especially with her tongue, nor loved him so fervently as she should have done: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times she would cast her Bible from her, and say, It was indeed the Book of Life, but she had read the same unprofitably, and therefore feared it was become to her the Book of Death: Sometimes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:117874:209"/> she complained that her sins had made her a prey to Satan, a spectacle to the World, a disgrace to Religion, and a shame to her Husband, Kindred, and all true Christians, and then she would weep bitterly: Sometimes she was troubled for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall corruption of her nature, the sins of her Parents; Yea, and of our First Parents, as if it had made her unworthy of God, &amp;c. Sometimes she accused her self of impatience; bewailed her want of feeling Gods Spirit: doubted of her Election, &amp;c. She wished that she had never been born, or that she had been made any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rather then a woman: oft-times she cryed out, <hi>Wo, wo, wo, a weak, a wofull, a wretched, a forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken woman, &amp;c.</hi> with tears continually trickling from her eyes: She complained of grievous thirst, such as all the water in the Sea could not quench, and yet refused, or drank very little: Sweat burst out upon her exceedingly; at other times her body burned extreamly: Sometimes she was very dull in prayer, and once, as she should have said, <hi>Lead us not into tentation,</hi> she stopped, saying, <hi>I may not pray, I may not pray, being thus interrupted by Satan:</hi> Yet her friends left her not, till she could both pray, and make confession of her Faith, with spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall application to her self.</p>
                     <p>These fits, though grievous to her self, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to her friends, yet they were neither long, nor continuall, but in the middest of them she would give good evidences of her faith, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and fighting against her tentations, and by <note place="margin">Her faith.</note> Prayer, begging strength of God against them:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117874:210"/> Oft she would with a cheerfull countenance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her friends not to faint, nor to give her over, but constantly to pray, and to help her against the Tempter: One of them once demanding, whether she believed the promises? and whether she could pray? she answered: <hi>O that I could, I would willingly, but he wil not let me: Lord, I believe, help my unbelief▪</hi> And when he told her that her desires, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were accepted for performance in Christ; she was much comforted at it: Once after a great conflict with Satan, she said, <hi>Satan, reason not with me, I am but a weak woman, if thou hast any thing to say, say it to my Christ; he is my Advocate, my Strength, and my Redeemer, and he shall plead for me:</hi> Sometimes being afflicted with the sight of her sins, and want of comfort, with many a pitifull sob, and much weeping, she would say: <hi>Pray to the Lord</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>to help, and comfort me, a poor, wofull, distressed woman:</hi> A godly Christian friend took much pains with her, minding her of Gods mercies, Christs merits, the many gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises contained in the Word, &amp;c. which through Gods blessing greatly refreshed her, and gave her occasion many times to call upon God, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of grace, and deliverance from those grievous tentations, wherein the Lord shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter answered her desires, so that she began to feel her self in a very good measure delivered from her former fears, and afflictions: but the day before her death, she was wholly released, and filled <note place="margin">Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable.</note> with abundance of inward consolations: and from the beginning that her comforts appeared, she
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:117874:210"/> would very cheerfully joyn with the company in Prayer, and singing of Psalms: One day her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, holy Master <hi>John Bruen,</hi> coming to visit her; he said, Sister be not dismaid at your troubles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what the Apostle saith, <hi>That judgement must begin at the House of God,</hi> to whom she answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, True it is, and <hi>if it begin at us, and the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shall scarcely be saved, where shall the sinners and ungodly appear?</hi> During this time she often pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would rehearse many comfortable Texts of Scripture, especially the eighth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> closing up all with Prayer, and most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble application thereof to her self, with much joy: When food was brought her, she would pray God, not onely to Sanctifie those creatures for her bodily sustinance, but also to fill her soul with the waters of life, often repeating, <hi>To him that thirsteth will I give of the Waters of Life freely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Once she took her Bible in her hand, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kissing of it, she said, <hi>O Lord, it is good for me to be afflicted, that I may learn thy Statutes: The Law of thy mouth is better to me then thousands of Gold and Silver:</hi> At another time, calling her Husband to her, she said, <hi>O Husband, beware of Popery, keep your self holy before the Lord, yield not to the abominations of the wicked, lest they rejoyce, and so you dishonor God, and destroy your own soul: Let my little child be brought up in the true fear of God, &amp;c. So shall I meet her in Heaven, whom I must now leave behind me on Earth:</hi> She often repeated, <hi>We have not received the spirit of Bondage to fear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:117874:211"/>
                        <hi>but the spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father,</hi> which last words she often doubled over: She often also repeated,</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I wil give thanks unto the Lord,</l>
                        <l>And praises to him sing; <note place="margin">

                        </l>
                        <l>Because he hath heard my request,</l>
                        <l>And granted my wishing.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>The day before her death the Lord discovered himself more plentifully to her, from which time, to her death, she was freed from Satans tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: She laid aside all thoughts of the world, husband, child, or any thing else: She lay with a cheerful countenance, as one ravished in her spirit: Her tongue overflowed with the praises of God: Her husband reading some portions of Scripture to her: When he came to that <hi>John</hi> 17. 4. <hi>I have finished the work that thou gavest me to do, and now glorifie me:</hi> She desired him to pause, and then said: Blessed be thy Name, O blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: Perfect the work, I humbly beseech thee that thou hast begun in me: When he read <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, for they are thine:</hi> She said, O Lord Jesus, Dost thou pray for me! O blessed, and sweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, How wonderful! How wonderful! How wonderful are thy Mercies! Read on: The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedest reading that ever I heard, the comfort whereof doth sweeten my soul: When he read <hi>vers.</hi> 22. <hi>The glory that thou gavest me, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, that they may be one, as we are one:</hi>
                        <pb n="117" facs="tcp:117874:211"/> With marvellous joy she said: I confess before the Lord his loving kindness, and his wonderful works before the sons of men, for he hath satisfied my soul, &amp; filled my hungry soul with goodness: When he read <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>Father, I will that they which thou hast given me, be with me, even where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> &amp;c. Stay, said she, let me meditate on the goodness of the Lord, For this is the sweetest saying that ever came to my soul: For now I perceive, and feel, that the countenance of Christ my Redeemer is turned towards me, and the bright-shining beams of his mercy are spread over me: O happy am I that ever I was born to see this blessed day: Praise, praise, O praise the Lord for his mercies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O my sweet Saviour, shall I be one with thee, as thou art one with the Father? Wilt thou glorifie me with that glory which thou hadst with the Father before the world was? And dost thou so love me, dust and ashes, to make me partaker of glory with Christ? What am I poor wretch, that thou art so mindful of me? O how wonderful! how wonderful! how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful is thy Love: O thy Love is unspeakable: O I feel thy mercies, And O that my tongue, &amp; heart were able to sound forth thy praises as I ought, and willingly would: O help me to praise the God of all consolations: And thus she continued for five hours space, praising the Lord with a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and heavenly countenance, testifying such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy, from a comfortable feeling of <hi>Gods</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in her soul, using such sweet sentences and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared phrases of Divine eloquence, as was most
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:117874:212"/> admirable: Some part whereof was thus: <hi>O my Lord God, Blessed be thy Name for evermore, thou hast shewed me the path of life: Thou didest, O Lord, for a little season hide thy face from me, But with everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting mercy thou hast had compassion on me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou art come with fulness of joy, and abundance of conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Help me, O help me to praise the Lord:</hi> Then she sang with as sweet a voyce as ever she did in her life the third Psalm, concluding thus:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>The Lord, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi>

                        <l>Be blest for evermore:</l>
                        <l>Let all the people say Amen:</l>
                        <l>Praise ye the Lord therefore.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Then she said, <hi>O praise the Lord, for he hath filled me with joy and gladness of heart: My line is faln un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in a pleasant place: I have a goodly Heritage: for the Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance: O how pleasant is the sweet perfume of the place where I lie: It is sweeter then</hi> Aarons <hi>composed Perfume of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Spices: How comfortable is the sweetness I feel: It is like that Odour that proceeds from the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Censor, that delights my soul: The taste is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, Do you not feel it? Sweeter it is then myrrh, the hony, or the hony Comb:</hi> Then she sang <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then she prayed to, and praised God again: Then she sang <hi>Psal.</hi> 136. A Christian friend seeing her exceeding joys, prayed for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of them to the end: Whereupon she said, <hi>O the joys! the joys! the joys that I feel in my soul! O they be wonderful! they be wonderful! they be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful!</hi> After a while she fell into a short slumber,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:117874:212"/> and then awaking, she said, <hi>O come kiss me with the kisses of thy mouth, for thy love is better then wine: O how sweet the kisses of my Saviour be? Mine eyes are opened</hi> (blessed be God) <hi>I do feel, and see the everli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercies of my Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O how merciful, and marvellous gratious art thou unto me? I feel thy mercy, I am assured of thy love, and so certain am I thereof, as thou art the God of Truth: Even so sure do I know my self to be thine, O Lord my God, and this my soul knoweth right well, and this my soul knoweth right well:</hi> Then she sang the fourth Psalm: And afterwards said, <hi>I am sure that my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liveth, and that I shall see him at the last day,</hi> &amp;c. Then a Godly Minister coming to her, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>William Harrison.</hi>
                        </note> she said to him: <hi>My soul hath been compassed about with terrors of death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A roaring wilderness of wo was within me: But blessed, blessed, blessed be the Lord my God, who hath not left me comfortless; but like a good Shepheard, hath brought me into a place of rest, even to the sweet running waters of life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O blessed, blessed be the Lord, that hath thus comforted me, and hath brought me to a place sweeter then the Garden of</hi> Eden: <hi>O the joy! the joy! the delightsom joy that I feel! O how wonderful! how wonderful! how wonderful is this joy! O praise the Lord for his mercy, and for this joy that my soul feeleth full well:</hi> And thus she continued, divers praying with her at sundry times: And immediatly before one began his prayer, she said to her self: <hi>Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord be thou my helper, thou hast loosed my sack, and girded me with gladness: Therefore will I praise thee, O Lord my God, I will</hi>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:117874:213"/>
                        <hi>give thanks to thee for evermore:</hi> On the Sabbath Evening herst rength and speech beginning to fail her, she said, <hi>My Warfare is accomplished, and mine iniquities are pardoned: Lord, Whom have I in heaven but thee? and I have none on earth but thee: My flesh faileth, and my heart also, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever: He that preserveth</hi> Jacob, <hi>and defendeth his</hi> Israel, <hi>he is my God, and will guide me unto death,</hi> &amp;c. And with that she presently fell asleep in the Lord, passing a way in peace, without any motion of body at all, <hi>May, ult. Anno Christi</hi> 1601. And of her Age 22.</p>

                        <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> that by experience he might ripen that knowledge which before he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for a guide, and Tutor for him in his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, he chose and sent over with him one Master <hi>Tovy,</hi> a grave, learned, and religious man, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the head Master of the Free-School in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry:</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:117874:215"/> what age and condition soever: He usually rose every morning about four or five a clock, seldom sleeping above six hours: When he first waked, his constant care was to set his heart in order, and to fit it for holiness all the day after, offering the first fruits of the day, and of his thoughts unto God: Being up, he read a Chapter out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, then with his servants in his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he went to prayer; then he spent about an hour in reading some holy Treatise, to enliven his affections, and encrease his knowledge: He read over <hi>Calvins Institutions,</hi> and <hi>Rogers</hi> his Treatises, which were his two last Books: Before Dinner and Supper, he had a Psalm, Chapter, and Prayer <note place="margin">Family du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> in his Family, and a Psalm sung, and Prayer after Supper: and besides these publike duties, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed privately every morning in his Closet, then betook himself to some serious study for three or <note place="margin">His studies.</note> four hours together, except he was interrupted by some special business: The residue of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he spent in converse with his friends, riding the great Horse, or some such other honest and Noble recreation till Dinner time; Thus avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idleness, and preventing temptations, which ensue thereupon ordinarily; presently after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he retired into his study to meditate upon some Sermons that he had lately heard, or if he was disappointed of that opportunity, he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected not the first that was offered to him; yea, many times in his Travels by Land, or Water, he thus busied himself, the rest of the afternoon he spent in businesses, study of Histories, the Art
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:117874:216"/> of War, Mathematicks, and Navigation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he attained to a great measure of perfection: After supper he prayed with his servants, then withdrew himself into his study, where he kept a Diary, or Day-book, wherein he recorded what <note place="margin">His Diary.</note> he had done that day; how he had offended, or what good he had done; what temptations he met with, and how he had resisted them: and surveying his failings, he humbled himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for them; and for such failings as were fit to be known onely to God and his own soul, he wrote them down in a private Character, which none could read but himself, and then betook himself to his rest; and to prevent evill thoughts before sleep, one that waited upon him in his Chamber, read a Chapter, or two out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures to him, and this practice he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for four years together before his death.</p>
                     <p>And as his care was thus in private to walk with God, so no less was his care in publike also, which appeared especially in his use of the time, and means of Gods worship. He was a most reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious observer of the Lords Sabbaths, both in <note place="margin">His sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Sabbaths.</note> publike and private duties, yet preferring (as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten professed) the publike before the private, so that though he had an houshold Chaplain, yet he ever frequented the publike Assemblies twice a day; yea, whilest he was a Courtier: and if his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions cast him into a place where the word was not preached, he would ride to some other place, sometimes four miles, rather then want it: Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Sermon, he withdrew himself
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:117874:216"/> from company for about half an hour, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon, and apply what he had heard to his own Soul: after the Evening Sermon, two of his servants having written, he caused them to repeat both the Sermons in his Family before Supper; and such was his memory, that usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he could remember, and speak of more then they had written; then he wrote them down in his Book, and prayed himself with his Family, wherein he had an excellent gift: And by way of preparation to the Sabbath, every Saturday night he used to call himself to a strict account how he had spent the whole week, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to humble himself for his failings, and to return praise to God for mercies received from him: On the Sabbath morning, rising betimes, he used, as he was making himself ready, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to his servant those Sermons which he had heard the Lords day before: He used Monthly to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and to fit himself to feast at the Lords Table, he kept a private Fast the day before, and then he <note place="margin">Fasting, and Prayer.</note> looked over his Book for his carriage that month, and spent the whole day in prayer, meditation, and self-examination, observing how it was with him since his last receiving, what progress he had made in piety, how he had thrived in grace, and what more strength he had gotten over his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and thus he spent the whole day, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">His prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> out of his Study till about Supper time: Also the morning before he received, he read over 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Wherein is contained the institution of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:117874:217"/> the Lords Supper, and to his servants that were to communicate with him, he read a little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise to them; wherein the right manner of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was contained; and besides these month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fasts, he kept many other days of afflicting his soul upon sundry occasions: He was wondrous attentive in hearing the word of God preached, or <note place="margin">Reverence in hearing Sermons.</note> read, and carried himself exceeding reverently therein, knowing that he was in the presence of God, that was no respecter of persons, and that he heard not the words of a man, but of God: Shewing thereby, that when he came to hear, he willingly laid down his honor at Christs feet; and to avoid ostentation, or the appearance of it in his private duties, he never admitted any one, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his prayer, or repetition of Sermons in, and with his Family, but onely one friend, that was <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edward Harwood.</hi>
                        </note> most intimate with him. And thus was this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly servant of Christ blameless, and pure, and the son of God without rebuke, in a naughty and crooked generation, amongst whom he shined as a Light in the world, holding forth the words of Life, that he might rejoyce in the day of Christ, that he had not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</p>
                     <p>He further manifested the sincerity of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <note place="margin">His love to the Saints.</note> by his love to all that were truly godly, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to faithfull, and painfull Ministers; as also by his mercy, and charity to the needy Saints, and poor members of <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> After <note place="margin">His Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> his return from his Travels, by way of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to God, he gave yearly, by the hand of a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:117874:217"/> private friend, twenty pounds to the poor, and the second Sabbath after his landing in <hi>England</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spent the day before with his Tutor, Master <hi>Tovy,</hi> in fasting, prayer, and thanksgiving) he heard the Word, received the Sacrament, and gave to poor of that Parish, five pounds; and besides, he gave forty pounds to be bestowed upon poor Ministers, and other Christians, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their necessities: Yea, such were his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of tender mercy, that he gave the tenth part of his yearly allowance, which was a thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> to pious and charitable uses, besides much that he gave occasionally, as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, walked abroad, &amp;c. And all his other graces were beautified, and adorned with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humility, which is rarely found in persons so <note place="margin">Humility.</note> honorable, and honored both by God and men. From the first day of his last sickness, he strongly apprehended the approach of his death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">His last sickness.</note> accordingly prepared himself for it (though others thought of nothing less then his death:) Besides his private meditations, he called often for others to pray with him, prayed often himself: made confession of his sins, and oft confessed his Faith, and undoubted hope of salvation by Christ, <note place="margin">Faith.</note> professing with much cheerfulness that he feared not Death in what shape soever it came: He utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many heavenly speeches, desiring to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and to be at home with God, and his Father, professing not above two hours before his death, that he still felt the assured comforts, and joys of his salvation by <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and when death it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:117874:218"/> self approached, he breathed forth these longing expressions, <hi>O that joy! O my God, when shall I be with thee?</hi> and so in the middest of those longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, <note place="margin">Death.</note> he sweetly and quietly resigned up his spirit unto God, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1613. And of his Age 22.</p>
                     <p>He was not so eminent in place, as he was in grace, his gifts and graces, and power of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were exceeding rare; So that the Papists, who brag so much of merits, and good works, cannot bring forth a parallel example amongst them, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man of his age, honor and rank, nay scarce of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny age, or degree whatsoever, that shewed so much power of Popery, or the form of seeming sanctity, as this young Nobleman did of true Piety, and power of godliness.</p>

Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was to have made this their Son <hi>Philip</hi> a Church-man; by reason that his Uncle <hi>Bertin de Mornay,</hi> who possessed divers Benefices, intended to resign them all to him: But Gods providence (which would not suffer him to be tempted with such a Bait) permitted not this Uncle to think of it at his death. His first Master was one <hi>Gabriel</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                        <hi>Prestat,</hi> who together with humane Learning, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed gently into him some principles of true doctrin, though he durst not make any open mention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion unto him, both because he knew his tender age incapable of it, and like wise for fear of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who knew not that this <hi>Gabriel</hi> was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant. <note place="margin">He went to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </note> He was afterwards brought to <hi>Paris</hi> by
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:117874:219"/> his Father, where he continued for two years, though in that time the course of his Studies was often interrupted by sickness. About the end of the year 1560. he was called from <hi>Paris</hi> to his Fathers Funerall; A certain Priest being sent to fetch him, who perceived that his Mother was no friend to the superstitions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gave him this counsel upon the way; That he should take heed of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> opinions, of which his Mother was suspected, and that he <note place="margin">Tentation.</note> should always persist in that Religion in the which he had been nourished and taught. Master <hi>Du Plessis</hi> (a little astonished by reason of his age) gave him this answer; That he was resolved to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue firm in what he had learned of the service of God; and that if he should doubt of any point of it, he would diligently read the <hi>Gospels,</hi> and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> for his better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation therein. Being arrived at his Mothers, he was solicited by her, and his elder Brother, to read the Protestant Catechism, which he refused, but withal demanded a <hi>New Testament</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> one of the <hi>Geneva</hi> Impression being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto him, he likewise refused it, but accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one Printed at <hi>Lyons,</hi> which he greedily <note place="margin">Scriptures studied with Prayer.</note> read, praying God to enlighten him in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his truth; and withal carefully observing, that the chief doctrines &amp; services of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were not to be found in Scripture, such as <hi>Purgatory, Invocation of Saints,</hi> the Sacrifice of the <hi>Mass,</hi> adoration of <hi>Images, &amp;c.</hi> Each of these still as he found no mention of it in Scripture, he blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:117874:220"/> out of his mind, and began to suspect the rest: so that at last he desired to satisfie himself concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Transubstantiation, &amp; Justification, by reading <note place="margin">His conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> some controversies of that time, concerning those Subjects, which wrought so good effect in him, that about the end of the year, 1561. he became re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to quit the service of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> His Mother, though she exceedingly rejoyced to see that he had imbraced the truth, yet would not willingly have had him to profess it so soon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she as yet adhered outwardly to the Papists. <note place="margin">Carnal fear.</note> But God having about the same time cast her into a sickness, almost unto death, she interpreted it as an admonition to her, not to retain any longer the truth of God in unrighteousness, making a vow in express terms, in the presence of her Children, that if God would please of his mercy to raise her from <note place="margin">A Vow.</note> that bed of sickness, she would make open profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Gospel, which she performed at the end of the same year, 1561. About the beginning of the <hi>year,</hi> 1562. he was again sent to <hi>Paris</hi> by his <hi>Mother,</hi> where he had scarce continued 3. moneths, before the troubles for Religion brake forth, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to leave the City; being returned home, he <note place="margin">His sickness.</note> fell sick of a Plurisie, which with other infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so far interrupted his studies, that he forgot almost all which he had Learned: Whereupon his Mother had an intention to make him Page of the Kings Chamber. But peace being re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year, 1563. His importunities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far with her, as to return him once more to <hi>Paris,</hi> where in short time he recovered what <note place="margin">His return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:117874:220"/> before he had lost, so far as to out-go his Master, who was wont to listen to him, as if himself had been his Scholler. It is observable, that during this time of his continuance at <hi>Paris,</hi> he was never seen to play, or take other recreation then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding before his Master <hi>Plato's Timaeus,</hi> or <note place="margin">Industry.</note> some such like Author. About this time his. Uncle the Bishop of <hi>Nantis</hi> strove to win him back to the <note place="margin">Tentation:</note> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> exhorting him to read diligently the antient <hi>Doctors</hi> of the Church, &amp; the better to allure him thereto, he promised to resign unto him his Bishoprick, and to put him in present possession of a Priory; But he thanking him for his proffers, <note place="margin">Resisted.</note> answered, that he would remit himself wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, from whom he was confident, he should receive whatsoever was necessary for him. And afterwards did often by Letters mark out unto his said Uncle such passages of the Fathers as confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Protestant Religion, &amp; confuted that of the Papists. In the year, 1567. the second troubles ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing for Religion, he prevailed with his Mother, to permit him to put himself into the Army, with two of her Brothers; But the eternall providence of God, which reserved him to higher imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Speciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> brought it so to pass, that his horse falling upon him by the way, broke his leg, which forced him to return. This hurt was long in healing, and <note place="margin">His Travels.</note> at length constrained him to undertake a Voyage into forraign Countries, the use of Baths being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to his full recovery: Wherefore about the end of <hi>August,</hi> 1568. with much trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he went to <hi>Geneva,</hi> and from thence by <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:117874:221"/> to <hi>Hidelberg</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> There he lived in the House of <hi>Emanuel Tremellius,</hi> and began also his studies in the Civil Law, gaining immediately the affections of the most Learned in that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. <hi>September,</hi> 1569. he went to <hi>Frankford,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Italy,</hi> remaining some time at <hi>Padova</hi> to continue his studies in the Law, not that he intended this for his chief end, but desiring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the knowledge of Christian Religion, he would not be ignorant of the rest; His idle hours he passed in the Physick Garden, to learn the natures and names of the herbs and plants: in which he profited so far in a short time, that <hi>Guillandinus</hi> (the Director of that Garden) had him in singular admiration: Besides, at the same time he read over the greatest part of the Bible, under Rabbi <hi>Menaken</hi> a Jew, the most learned of that <note place="margin">He studies Hebrew.</note> Age in the holy Tongue.</p>
                     <p>At length the State of <hi>Venice</hi> making a League with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> against the <hi>Turk,</hi> occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a more strict search to be made by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Padova</hi> after such as professed the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion: of which profession Master <hi>du Plessis</hi> being known to be, retired himself to <hi>Venice</hi>
                        <note place="margin">He is in danger.</note> to Monsieur <hi>du Ferrier,</hi> then Embassador for the King of <hi>France</hi> there: And here likewise he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have come into some danger for his religion; <note place="margin">Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> For a certain Officer of the Inquisition, proffering him an Oath upon some Articles proposed unto him, he answered in <hi>Italian,</hi> That his Religion permitted him not to take it: The Officer mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding the word Religion (which in that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:117874:221"/> Language, most commonly signifies some Order of Friers) asked him if he were a religious person? Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> (understanding the Officers question of a Protestant, such being in <hi>France</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Religion) answered, yes, whereupon the Officer proceeded no further. Divers like dangers he escaped by the providence of God in other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> a Provost came by night, and examined him concerning his Country, his name, &amp;c. He told him his name was <hi>Philip de Mornay,</hi> the Provost not hearing <hi>du Plessis,</hi> by which name he was most ordinarily called, left him, supposing he was not the man he sought for; From <hi>Venice</hi> (having first seen the rest of <hi>Italy)</hi> he went to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and from thence by <hi>Hungary, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> to <hi>Franckfort,</hi> and so to <hi>Cologne,</hi> in the end of the year, 1571 here he was familiar with <hi>Philip Ximenes,</hi> Spaniard (the great friend of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander)</hi> with whom he had often Conference about Religion. <hi>Ximenes</hi> confessed many errors in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, but would by no means allow of a separation from it: <hi>du Plessis</hi> having obtained his Arguments in writing gave him an Answer to them, which those of <hi>Cologne,</hi> called <hi>Triduanum Scriptum:</hi> To which <hi>Ximenes</hi> promised, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave an answer. In the Spring, <hi>Anno</hi> 1572. He passed into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and so into <hi>England,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">He comes into <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> where he was favourably received by <hi>Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> who already had him in great esteem. At that time Monsieur <hi>de Montmocancy,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Foix,</hi> were newly arrived in <hi>England,</hi> to swear the League betwixt the <hi>Queen,</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> King
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:117874:222"/> of <hi>France.</hi> These intended to send <hi>du Plessis</hi> to the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> (then Prisoner in <hi>England)</hi> to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute her in the name of their Master. But when he perceived that he was to deliver some Letters se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly unto her, which made against the League, <note place="margin">His integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> he refused that Commission, Saying, That he would not begin his imployment by so evil an Action. At the end of <hi>July,</hi> 1572. he returned into <hi>France,</hi> and went to wait upon the Admiral at <hi>Paris;</hi> That fatall marriage being then ready to be solemnized between the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> His mother was then in the City upon her return home, and himself ready to accompany her: When news was brought that the Admiral was hurt, whom presently he ran to help, and to aid him to his lodging. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways suspected that marriage, but this wicked act confirmed his suspition. Wherefore desiring his Mother instantly to depart, he resolved himself to stay and attend the issue of what he suspected. Upon <hi>Bartholomew-Day</hi> (the day of that horrid <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Massacre.</note> Massacre) the Messenger whom he had sent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the Admirals health, returned affrighted, and told him, that the Admirals lodging was broke open by force: At which sudden news, he leapt out of his bed, and putting on his clothes, felt an extraordinary motion in himself, which caused him to say, God will deliver me out of <note place="margin">Predictions.</note> this danger, and I shall see it revenged: On the contrary <hi>Ramini</hi> (his Tutor) presently answered, And I shall die in it. Both which came to pass. Whilst he intended to hasten to the Admirals
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:117874:222"/> Lodging, divers hinderances kept him within, till the murderers arrived at his house, so that he had scarce time to burn his Papers, and save himself <note place="margin">A special providence.</note> on the top of the house, till they were gone. A day or two he lay hid in <hi>Paris,</hi> and on the third day of the Massacre, he slipt out of the City (though not <note place="margin">His flight.</note> without much trouble and danger) under the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise of a Lawyers Clerk: Arriving at his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he found the Family dispersed, and her self concealed by a mean Gentleman of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; Having saluted her, he resolved to venture for <hi>England:</hi> To which end, one proffering to procure for him the Duke <hi>de Guise</hi> his Pass, he refused it, saying, <hi>That he would not ow his life to</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Holy cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note>
                        <hi>such, for whose service he should be loath to imploy it;</hi> That <hi>God had delivered him from the Massacre, and therefore into his hands he would commit his passage;</hi> and within two or three days, finding a Boat at <hi>Diep,</hi> he passed in it safe to <hi>England:</hi> Where he had been recommended to the Queen by the Lord <hi>Walsingham,</hi> then Ambassador in <hi>France:</hi> Being there, he wrote some Remonstrances in Latine and French; by which he exhorted the Queen to the defence of the afflicted Church; and confuted by some Apologies, the calumnies imposed upon the Protestants: He was likewise imployed in the Treatie of Marriage betwixt the Duke of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi> (brother to the <hi>French</hi> King) and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth.</hi> This Duke, by reason of some differences betwixt his brothers and himself, took up Arms, and made use of the Protestants, as a descontented party, to assist him; to joyn with whom,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:117874:223"/> Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> was much solicited, which occasioned him at length to return into <hi>France;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> but withall he expressed his dislike of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Interest of Religion with the Dukes Ambitious, and discontented Ends. This war not succeeding, he retired himself to <hi>Jametz,</hi> till the death of King <hi>Charls</hi> the seventh, who died, <hi>Anno</hi> 1574. After which he came to <hi>Sedan,</hi> where he was desired by the Dutchess of <hi>Bouillon</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a journey to the Duke of <hi>Cleve,</hi> who with the Elector <hi>Palatin,</hi> had been by her late husband constituted Executors of his Will; which (though a business of much hazard) was undertaken by him, and performed to the great contentment of the Dutchess. During his sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">His marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> at <hi>Sedan,</hi> he married <hi>Charlotte Arbaleste,</hi> a widdow, who having likewise escaped the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre at <hi>Paris,</hi> was fled thither for Religion: At whose request he composed his Treatise of <hi>Life and Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Year 1576. He went to the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> in <hi>Guienne,</hi> who immediatly received him for one of his Counsel: To whom he did much service in the Wars, against the Pretended <hi>Holy League;</hi> In reference to which, he was by the said King imployed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. with an ample Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <note place="margin">He is sent into <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> to solicite her for aid against the Leaguers: Being arrived in <hi>May</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Queen</hi> (who was very prompt in such kinde of speeches) told him, That she had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him as Messenger from a Duke, but now she saw him as Ambassadour from a King. At his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:117874:223"/> Audience he obtained from her the sum of eighty thousand Crowns to levy men in <hi>Germany</hi> for that war; which nevertheless were not raised, by reason of the Peace which followed in the same year: During this abode in <hi>England,</hi> he composed his Treatise of the <hi>Church.</hi> Being resolved to pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> in <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1578. He took leave of the Queen at <hi>Norwich,</hi> who besides an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Present bestowed upon him, would have a particular Cypher for Letters to pass betwixt <note place="margin">He is robbed by Pyrats.</note> them: In his passage he was robbed by Pyrats, where he left (besides other things) his Papers, amongst which there were some Books of the History of his Time in Latine, which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, <hi>Anno</hi> 1570. Arriving at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the Treatie of Alliance betwixt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Duke <hi>Casimir,</hi> and the <hi>Estates;</hi> in the which he caused likewise to be included the King <note place="margin">Popish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</note> of <hi>Navarr</hi> his Master: He was afterward poisoned by one <hi>Guerin,</hi> who had been hired to poison the <note place="margin">God's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</note> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but his youth and good consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution overcame the force of the Poison: During his, stay here, about the midst of the year, 1579. he began his work of the <hi>Truth of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> of which when he had finished about four <note place="margin">His sickness.</note> Chapters, he fell into a grievous sickness, which the Physitians judged to be caused by the reliques of the Poison which he had taken. This continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, and the Plague raging in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> he was invited by those of <hi>Gant,</hi> for change of Air, unto their City, where, they provided and furnished a house for him. There he spent the rest
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:117874:224"/> of that year, and begun the next, <hi>viz.</hi> 1580. And no sooner had recovered his health in part, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly he set himself to the continuance of his work. But he was that Spring taken off by new imployments.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> again took up Arms, and commanded Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> (laying all other business aside) to make another journey to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to demand succours; which he immediatly <note place="margin">He is again sent to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> undertook: The Queen of <hi>England</hi> was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make Peace with the King of <hi>France,</hi> so that this Embassage was not very agreeable to her: Yet after his return to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> she wrote a Letter with her own hand to Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> telling him, that he should be welcome when ever he pleased to return into <hi>England;</hi> and that never any <note place="margin">Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to him.</note> Gentleman had treated with her, in whom she took so much pleasure as in himself: At <hi>Antwerp</hi> he finished his Book of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> which the year after himself turned into Latine. <hi>Anno</hi> 1582. He returned into <hi>France,</hi> where he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a Treatise, containing the Reasons why the Counsel of <hi>Trent</hi> could not be admitted in <hi>France,</hi> Printed by command of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. In the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (1583.) He was sent by the King of <hi>Navar</hi> to the National Synod of <hi>Vitray</hi> in <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> where <note place="margin">He is sent to a Synod.</note> he was joyfully received by the whole Company, with this preface, That had they met him occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the streets, they should have earnestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned his presence with them. He was likewise present in the General Assembly of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants held at <hi>Montauban,</hi> by the Kings permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:117874:224"/> in the year 1584. where he was desired by the Assembly to draw up the form of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against the violation of the Edict for Peace, which he, together with the Count <hi>de Laval,</hi> presented afterwards to the King at <hi>Blois.</hi>

                     <p>The League of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> breaking forth in the year 1585. which was formed first against the King, under pretence of the defence of the Catholike Religion, &amp; afterwards declared against the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the Protestants: That fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Declaration in the name of the said King, was penned by Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> wherein the King, having answered the Calumnies cast upon <note place="margin">A Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge.</note> him by that Faction, proposed (to avoid the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of a Civil war) that the quarrel might be ended betwixt himself and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the inequalitie of their conditions, by a combate, either of one to one, two to two, or ten to ten, more or less, at the choise of the said Duke: To which Declaration Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> would not set his hand, till the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> had promised that he should be one of the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, if the Conditions should be accepted. But this not being accepted by the Duke, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Civil wars for Religion; in which Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> did many necessary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portent Services for the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and the Protestants, both with his Sword and Pen, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving answered a virulent book published by the League against the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> called the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Catholique:</hi> Besides his assistance in the General Assembly of the Protestants at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and his

At which As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly in writings so far prevailed, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of the Deputies concluded a Peace to be made with the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> and much ado there was to make them at length change their language.</p>
                     <p>After the death of the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> at <hi>Blois,</hi> there followed a Truce betwixt the Kings, in the year 1589. Upon which Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> was <note place="margin">He is made Governor of <hi>Saumur.</hi>
                        </note> by the King of <hi>France</hi> made Governor of <hi>Saumur.</hi> One memorable passage during these wars cannot well be omitted, which was, That the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> having abused the daughter of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Rochel</hi> (by whom he had a son) the Church had often remonstrated his fault unto him, which he ingeniously confessed, but could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to take off the scandal by a publike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of it, till Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">His Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> him counsel about a Battel which was then ready to be fought, took the opportunity to tell him how necessary it was to seek the favour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, the onely giver of Victory, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon urged him to consult with his Conscience, whether he ought not to give glory to God upon such an occasion, and what remorse it would breed in him, if God for want of it should blast his undertakings, to the ruine of so good a Cause; which so neerly touched the Kings heart, that he commanded him to consult with a Minister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:117874:225"/> what he had to do in that business; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to whose advice he made the next day a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Acknowledgment of his fault in the Church <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Navarr</hi> doth Penance.</note> before all the Nobility of his Army. Which counsell being thought by some to be too Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> made this answer, <hi>That as a man could not be too couragious before men, so he could not be too humble in the presence of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After the murther of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, by a <note place="margin">King of <hi>France</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.</note>
                        <hi>Jacobin</hi> at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> 1587. Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> was made Counseller of Estate to the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> (now <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>France)</hi> whom he served in the recovery of his right against the League of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> though with much hazard to himself, some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been, by their own confession, hired to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.</note> him, for which they were executed at <hi>Tours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> then Pope, being one of the Kings chiefest Enemies, an expedient was propounded of taking him off by some honorable Embassage, and to that end the question was put, whether the King might with a safe conscience write to him? Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> answered, That doubtless he might, it being ordinary in the same case for Christian Princes to write unto the Turk; so that the question was not, if he should write, but how? Since the King could not cal him <hi>holy Father,</hi> or kiss his feet, whom according to his profession, he ought to think the enemy of Christ, and if he should write otherwise it would be to no purpose. This expedient therefore was wholly laid aside.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:117874:226"/> to joyn interests with the King, fearing the too great potency of <hi>Spain,</hi> sent a Gentleman to him, who proffered to Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> twenty thousand Crowns a year, if he would counsel the King to change his Religion, to which he stoutly replyed, <hi>That his Masters conscience was not to be</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Courage.</note>
                        <hi>sold, no more then his own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the year 1590. He built a Church for the Protestants in <hi>Saumur,</hi> and obtained a grant from the King, for the Instituting of an <hi>Ʋniversity</hi> there, which was afterwards confirmed by a Nationall <hi>Synod</hi> held in the same place. The King besieging <hi>Rouen,</hi> in the year, 1591. and fearing the Army of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> which was then entred <hi>France,</hi> intending to raise that siege; Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> was again sent into <hi>England,</hi> to demand aid from the <hi>Queen,</hi> where he had conference with some <hi>English</hi> Bishops, concerning the differences betwixt them, and the <hi>Non▪conformists,</hi> remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating unto them, with what conscience they could molest those, who agreed in the same faith with them, onely for some simple Ceremonies, with whose infirmities they ought rather charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to bear; which Remonstrance caused them for a while to be more gently dealt with, instead of the persecution which was intended against them.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1593. He wrote a large Letter to the King, who then had changed his Religion, desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the continuance of his favour to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, and withall expostulating that sudden change, assuring him nevertheless of their fidelity
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:117874:226"/> towards him, and resolution to obey their lawfull Prince, of what Religion soever, even to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their lives. Meeting him afterwards (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to command) at <hi>Chartres,</hi> the King some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled at the first enterview, began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse what he had done, by telling him that he had been necessitated to sacrifice himself for his Protestant Subjects, that he might with more ease procure a peace for them: To which Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> answered, That there were better expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients for the working of that end, had his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie been pleased to have made use of them, and that it would have been more agreeable to their minds to have sacrificed their lives for him. About this time he obtained of the King a revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such Edicts as had been made by the Leaguers against the Protestants, and a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, by which the free exercise of their Religion had been formerly granted unto them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno,</hi> 1595. He began his work of the Lords <hi>Supper,</hi> which he finished in less then a year; In which Book his principall end was, to represent the belief and practise of Antiquity in most part of the points controverted in Religion; which design the King had heretofore approved, as a means to facilitate a reformation: This Book was afterward approved by the Nationall Synod at <hi>Saumur,</hi> though not Printed untill the year, 1598. The publication of it stirred up many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against him, especially of the Clergy: The Jesuites of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> petitioned the Parliament there, that it might be burned; The Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:117874:227"/> by express Letters complained of it to the King, that one of his Privy Counsell should dare to call him Anti-Christ. The King nevertheless took no notice of it, onely sometimes he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his friends, that he was sorry that Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> had by this means given him occasion not to put him upon further Employments; which likewise he desired Monsieur <hi>de la Force</hi> to tell him; To whom <hi>du Plessis</hi> answered, That he had not done this act rashly, but upon good consideration; That the King knew well, that he was ever wont to distribute his services first to God, next to his King, and then to his friends; <note place="margin">Pietie.</note> which method he could not with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence change; That he was not ignorant how much this would hinder his preferments in the world, which he regarded not so much, as to do the least <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> service for his God; That however God was faithfull, and would honor such as honor him, and much more to the like effect. But the Pope still underhand solicited the King to ruin him, whom in all his Letters he called his enemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting that he had punished one in <hi>Rome</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spit upon the Kings <hi>Effigies,</hi> how much more ought the King to punish him who had so irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently used Gods Vicar: And so far was the King led away by his frequent solicitations, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the important services of Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> he sought all possible occasions to cast him off, which though ordinarily not hard to find in one who had so high a Charge in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the Common-wealth, yet (by the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:117874:227"/> grace of God assisting him) Calumnie could not find on that side where to fasten. At last (having nothing else to accuse him of) his Book must be laid hold of, for a pretence to ruin him, in which the Bishop of <hi>Eureux, du Perron</hi> promised to shew five hundred false quotations: <hi>Du Plessis</hi> on the contrary offered to make good all the passages ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Book, out of Impressions approved by his adversaries. Whereupon a Conference was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at <hi>Fountainbleau.</hi> But the <hi>Sorbonists</hi> fearing lest the examination of particulars would prove to their disadvantage, desired the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and he the King, to hinder it: The King desired him not to trouble himself, since he would so manage the business, that the disgrace should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon the Protestants, which he intended to bring to pass, by ordaining, that at the Conference the Bishop should open the Book, and name to the number of fifty passages, if the time would permit, to which <hi>du Plessis</hi> was to make answer <hi>ex tempore,</hi> otherwise he was resolved to verifie the Bishops accusation. This being told to <hi>du Plessis,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it was a hard condition for him, to make an unpremeditated answer to such quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the Bishop should pick out of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand alledged in that Book, to the retaining of all which, no humane memory could suffice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the conditions were a little (though very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) qualified, and thus proposed; That the Bishop should quote unto him sixty passages over night, to which he was to answer at eight the next morning. Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> (after ardent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:117874:228"/> to God) accepted the condition: About one <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> of the Clock after mid-night the sixty passages were brought to him, quoted onely thus, <hi>Scotus p.</hi> 869. <hi>Durand. pag.</hi> 870, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides that, the Books which he borrowed of the Bishop (he having none there of his own) at two of the clock, were again sent for by six; yet in this space of four hours (though weak sighted) he had examined nineteen of the quoted passages; At eight of the clock he was called, though then put off till one in the afternoon, so that but nineteen of the quotations were examined; upon his answer to the first, the Moderators (being most part Papists) were ashamed, and pronounced in favour of Monsieur <hi>du Plessis;</hi> which they were about to have done likewise in the second, had not the King interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, which made them decide it against him. For the rest, they were chiefly such passages of <hi>Fathers,</hi> as the Bishop pretended, that <hi>du Plessis</hi> had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely quoted; in which, though <hi>du Plessis</hi> made it appear, that the words pretended to be fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left out, were all to the same effect; yet the Moderators judged, that it were good they had been added: This was the summ of that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; concerning which <hi>du Plessis</hi> Printed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Relation to vindicate himself: But the Bishop every where cried up the victory which he pretended to have gotten there, even in the Cathedrall Church, in a Sermon before the <note place="margin">Providences extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</note> King and Court at Whitsontide: (About a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night after the Conference) He was himself the Trumpet to his own praises: But that week a flash
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:117874:228"/> of Lightning broke into the Church, shattered the Pulpit where the Bishop had preached all the Holidays, burnt some Images, and at the same time fell likewise in the Kings Garden: Also on the Thursday following, the Bishop preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in a Church neer the <hi>Lowre,</hi> upon which Church, within two nights after, fell another flash of Lightning, which uncovered part of the Steeple, and beat down some Images; and at the same instant falling again into the Kings Garden, burned some Orange trees there. In these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, the very Adversaries of <hi>du Plessis</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the finger of God; Neither would they suffer the Bishop to preach any more in their Churches; besides, that himself made an oath to preach no more till Winter. Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> thus faln into disfavor with the King, began to lead a more private life, though he had still a large influence upon publike affairs: In the year 1602. A certain Monk had hired two young men to kill <note place="margin">Popish trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</note> him; who came in Sermon time into the Church, at <hi>Saumur,</hi> the one of them drawing so neer, as to <note place="margin">Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</note> lift up the Carpet which lay before him, but had not the boldness to strike: Being taken upon suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he confessed his intentions, and who set him on work; whereupon the Monk was apprehended, and hanged. Afterwards the King began again by little and little to favor him, moved thereunto, not onely out of his own inclinations, which had been alaways towards him, though thus clouded for a while, for fear of the Pope; but likewise by a Remonstrance from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:117874:229"/> had told his Ambassador, that she knew not how to trust his Master, who so far depended on the Pope, as for his sake to slight his best and most faithful servants.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>January, Anno</hi> 1605. The onely son of Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> was sent for to the Court by the King, who intended an imployment for him, where he was well received: But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon which he had been sent for, failing, he desired leave to go into <hi>Holland,</hi> which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">His son slain.</note> him, where he was the same year unhappily slain before <hi>Gueldres;</hi> which bred so great a grief in his mother, that she lived not long after, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting this life in <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1606. This was one of the most remakable <hi>Epoches</hi> in the whole Life of Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> in the which two such great &amp; so contiguous losses had befaln him: After his sons death, he had both his own grief to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with, and to comfort that of his wife: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">His wife dies.</note> her death he was wont to say, <hi>That heretofore she had been an aid to him in living well, and should hereafter be so in teaching him to die well;</hi> from <note place="margin">A good wife.</note> thenceforth he took this for his Motto, <hi>Mihi bis anhelo suprestes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The same year he was again himself called to the Court, and graciously received by the King, <note place="margin">He is sent for to Court.</note> where he continued, till the year following, at which time he desired leave of the King to retire himself, which the King unwillingly granted; withall, desiring him to come sometimes to Court, and expressing his grief that he could not employ him according as he desired, the reason
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:117874:229"/> whereof himself well knew, meaning the scandall which the Pope would have taken at it: Being returned to <hi>Saumur,</hi> he began his Work of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Iniquity, Anno</hi> 1607. which, though a work of infinite labour, yet he finished it in nine moneths. In which it is remarkable, that to spare his sight, he dictated it to others that wrote it from his mouth.</p>
                     <p>In the Spring, <hi>Anno</hi> 1608. He began to set upon those great Volumes of <hi>Baronius,</hi> to which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a confutation. About this time likewise were those Letters of his into <hi>Holland</hi> concerning the Novelties introduced into the Church by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius,</hi> to whom he advised the <hi>French</hi> Church, <note place="margin">His zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> to send one of their Ministers (naming Monsieur <hi>du Moulin)</hi> to confer with him concerning the Points by him maintained, and to adjure him in the Name of God to forbear begetting of Parties in the Church: This advise was approved by the Church, but fearing to offend the King, they durst neither ask his leave, nor send without it. <hi>Du Perron,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> now made Cardinal, and Archbishop of <hi>Sens</hi> was much pressed by the King to answer Mon. <hi>du Plessis,</hi> to which he was likewise urged by his friends, who told him that the Action at <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> was little to his credit, and that should <hi>du Plessis</hi> dye, it would be then too late to answer him, because men would be ready to say, that he durst not do it in his Life time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he promised, and undertook the business: And going to <hi>Rome,</hi> sequestred himself from other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness for the space of a year to perform it, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:117874:230"/> the Pope at his arrivall in <hi>France</hi> to print his answer, which he said was risen to a great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: Upon his return, the King asked him when he would print it? He told his Majesty that he stayed but for some Manuscripts from <hi>Rome;</hi> which answer, the King seeing his delays, used as a Proverb to some undertakers, whose work went not forward, who making idle excuses to him; Yes (sayes the King) <hi>I see you stay for Manuscrips from</hi> Rome <hi>too; Causabon,</hi> who was about the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, wrote to Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> concerning this Answer, telling him that it was finished, and that himself had seen it; whom <hi>du Plessis</hi> desired, as the Cardinals friend, to give him from him the same Counsel which Christ did to <hi>Judas</hi> in the Gospel; <hi>What thou dost, do quickly.</hi> But this Volume of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer never appeared: The Cardinal after the Kings murther, thinking himself to be disingaged from his promise, In <hi>October, An.</hi> 1609. Mon. <hi>du Plessis</hi> had notice given him of a Book in <hi>folio,</hi> seen in the house of one that was a Confident of the Jesuites, which was written to the half, containing divers Oaths signed with bloud; in which they obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to obey the commands of the Pope: of which he immediatly gave a secret advice to the Court; but by the evil conduct of him that was appointed to search for it, the Book missed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found. This year he turned into latine his Book of the <hi>Mysterie of iniquity,</hi> which he dictated so fast, that his <hi>Amanuensis</hi> had much ado to keep pace with him with his pen. The horrid murther of the <hi>King</hi> following in the year. 1610. he upon notice of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:117874:230"/> it, took so good order, as to keep the people about his government in quiet, who upon that sudden change were ready to take up arms: And as soon as he had received the Edict for the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> he administred the Oath of Fidelity to all the Clergy and People within his Jurisdiction; making a speech unto them, in which he desired them to forget the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing names of <hi>Papist</hi> and <hi>Protestant,</hi> which having caused so many misfortunes, ought to be buried in this great one: Professing, that whoever would shew himself a good French-man, and a faithfull Subject, should be of him respected as his Brother.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>May, An.</hi> 1611. was held in <hi>Saumur</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly of the <hi>Protestant Churches;</hi> where chusing a President, six of the sixteen Provinces were for the Duke <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> the other ten for Monsieur <hi>du Plessis;</hi> who being much troubled at it, desired them to chuse again, but was by the company commanded to take the place: At which the Duke being discontented, there followed a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention in that Assembly, manifestly tending to a Schism in the Church, which <hi>du Plessis</hi> (though a <note place="margin">A blessed peace maker.</note> party) much laboured to reconcile, and at last that was happily brought to pass in the Nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod held the year following at <hi>Privas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another dissention afterwards happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Monsieur <hi>du Moulin,</hi> Minister of the Church at <hi>Paris,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Tilenus,</hi> Professor at <hi>Sedan,</hi> about the effects of the Union of the two natures in Christ: The making up of this difference was,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:117874:231"/> by a Nationall Synod held at <hi>Tonneinx,</hi> referred to Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> who proved the happy Author of a full reconciliation betwixt them, in the year, 1614. Yet had this difference like to have broke forth again the year following, by the indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion (or malice rather) of some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, had not Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> in time stopped its progress: In which he was aided by a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Message of King <hi>James;</hi> who at that time <note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> mediates peace.</note> sent to invite <hi>du Moulin</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him about a method of Uniting all the Reformed Churches of Christendom, to which he had been often solicited by Monsieur <hi>du Ples<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis.</hi> The issue of which Voyage was, That the King resolved to send Letters to all Protestant Princes, to invite them to Union, and desired the French Churches to frame a confession gathered out of all those of other reformed Churches, in the which unnecessary points might be left out, as the means of begetting discord and dissention.</p>
                     <p>Some years following were spent by Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> in procuring the peace of the Protestant Churches, and endeavouring to keep a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence between the King and them, which was continually ready to be interrupted; in which business he carryed himself with so much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and fidelity in all occurrences between them, that he was admired, and praised by all, yea, even Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> himself (heretofore one of his greatest enemies) shewed him great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in the Assembly of Estates held at <hi>Rouen, An.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses him.</note> 1617. speaking of him in all companies with an
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:117874:231"/> excess of Prayses; and telling the King himself, that those men had done him wrong who had kept off Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> from having a greater power in the management of his affairs; And that his Religion ought not to render him unprofitable in the exercise of those graces which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; and that his Majestie ought to keep him neer his person so long as he should live. Which prayses the said <hi>Cardinal</hi> reiterated upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, in <hi>September, Anno,</hi> 1618. charging his friends then about him, to send a solemn <hi>Farewell</hi> from him to Monsieur <hi>du Plessis,</hi> and to manifest his sorrow for not having made a straighter league of friendship with him, having so high an esteem of his Conscience and integrity. His government of the Town and Castle of <hi>Saumur</hi> was continued unto him till the year, 1621. when the King falling into displeasure and suspicion of the Protestants, by reason of their high deportment in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Rochel,</hi> displaced him at first but for three moneths, with a promise of restoring him so soon as affairs should be a little quieted. But these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents growing to an open War, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver procure a re-establishment, though it were continually solicited by him; Wherefore retiring himself to his House in the Forrest upon <hi>Dayure,</hi> he continued there till the day of his death, which followed in the year, 1623. there applying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to holy meditations and exercises of Patience. He did by a particular providence of God make his last Will for the peace of his Family, and the <note place="margin">His prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death.</note> edification of those that should survive him; which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:117874:232"/> having finished upon the third of <hi>November,</hi> in the forementioned year, he expressed himself to be now discharged of one of his greatest cares, and that nothing was now left for him to do, but to die well. The next day he was seized by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Feaver, forcing him to keep his bed, which so continued and encreased upon him, that upon the ninth of the same moneth the Physicians gave over all hopes of his recovery: Nevertheless he lived for forty eight hours after, which he so well husbanded in the care of his salvation, that scarce one of those hours was employed in any other business. In all which time he gave both by word and action so many express and evident signs of his faith and assurance, that it may be truly said, that in this short time he confirmed by Irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofs all that he had said or written of the truth of Christian Religion. In all this time he felt little or no pain, so that when the Minster asked him how he did, he still would answer, <hi>Well, very well.</hi> His speech continued till the tenth day at midnight, which he continually imployed in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for himself and his enemies, and in comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble speeches to the by-standers; sometimes in the middest of his prayers, being heard to say, <hi>I fly, I fly to Heaven, the Angels are carrying me into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of my Saviour,</hi> sometimes repeating those words of <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer liveth, I shal see him with mine eyes, hisce oculis,</hi> repeating divers times these last words in Latine. Being asked if he felt not the Spirit within him sealing unto him the promises of God, he answered,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:117874:232"/>
                        <hi>Yes indeed, I am assured of it,</hi> and again, <hi>I feel, I feel what I speak.</hi> Two hours after, his speech, and his hearing failed him, and his breath between six <note place="margin">His Death.</note> and seven in the morning of the eleventh day, which was the hour that he yielded up his spirit into the hands of God his Creator, finishing by a happy death, a life of above seventy four years continuance, exemplarily spent in the fear of God, and the profession of his Gospel.</p>

                        <p>MOnsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> by an instinct from God, had made, and dictated his Testament, upon the twenty fourth day of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1623. In the which, for the peace of his Family, and the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his survivors, he had set down his last will and pleasure. But by reason of some interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient occasions, did not sign it till the third of <hi>November</hi> following, which having done, <hi>Now</hi> (said he) <hi>behold, I am discharged of one of my chiefest</hi>

                              </gap>yria.</hi> This sickness continuing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing upon him, the Physitians gave advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto his friends, upon Thursday the ninth of that month, that his estate was such, as no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane hopes were left that he could ever recover it. After which time God continued him upon earth for the space of forty eight hours, which he so well imployed in the Thoughts of himself, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:117874:233"/> his Salvation, that he scarcely spent any one intire hour of them upon any other business; giving both by his words and actions, such express and evident Testimonies of his Faith and Assurance, that it may be truly said, that in that short time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <note place="margin">Faith.</note> by irrefragable proofs, all that ever he had said or written concerning the truth of Christian Religion. The Gospel of the Son of God was plainly seen to be ingraved upon his heart by the Holy Spirit. He seemed in the midst of death to have obtained a firm possession of Life, &amp; to injoy a full contentment in that, at which most men are ordinarily affrighted. And this Lesson was so live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and efficatious, that even those who had the greatest share in the loss of him, reaped joy and consolation from the very subject of their grief: Would to God that all men could have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent there! Since it is impossible for any Pen to imprint that force upon his Expressions, which his own Accent, and the condition wherein he was, gave unto them. His words we shall indeavour to express; though wanting that soul and life which they had in his mouth: And while we recount them as such, we shall intreat such as were then present to remember, with what voyce and action they were accompained; and those that were absent to imagine what weight the Spirit and Tongue of such a Personage could add unto them, sealing by a happy Death, a Life of seventy four years, spent (as is publikely known) exemplarily in the fear of God, and the profession of his Gospel.</p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:117874:233"/>
                        <p> On Thursday, the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> Madam <hi>de Villarnoul</hi> his eldest daughter, coming in the morning to his bed side, where after having enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his health, as she stood silent, he told her that he desired some one might come and hold some good discourse with him: Upon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion they caused a Minister, being his houshold Chaplain, to come, that he might give him notice of the dangerous condition in which he was, and prepare him to undergo the Will of God. And though the Minister was much troubled to be the bearer of so sad a message, yet he used much live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness in the delivery, without making use of the circumstances wherewith men commonly usher in such discourses; To whom Monsieur <hi>du Plessis</hi> not any wayes moved or astonished, but with a countenance and spirit full of assurance, answered. Yea, saith he, is it true? I am very well content it should be so; And do in the first place pardon <note place="margin">Charity.</note> from my heart all such as have done or procured evil unto me: Further, beseeching God, that he would pardon and amend them. The Minister praising God for that he was thus ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give unto others their offences, which was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent sign that God would forgive him his; prayed him, that as he had edified the Church in his life time, so that now likewise he would do the same at his death, and since he still injoyed the use of his Tongue, that he would comfort and edifie the By-standers by his speeches. To which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That he had not his speech so free as they imagined; neither indeed could he speak without
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:117874:234"/> pain, nevertheless the desire which he had to give an outward Testimony of the internall disposition of his heart, made him in some measure overcome this hinderance: onely he abridged into as few words as he could all that he had to say. Then he began a Confession of his Faith, but not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to finish it, he lifted up himself from the Chair whereon he sate, and said to the Minister, I have a great account to make, having received much, and profited little; It being answered, that he had by the grace of God faithfully and happily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his Talent, having served the Church with much profit, and advanced the Kingdom of Christ. Alas, (said he) what was there of mine in that Work? Say not that it was I, but God by me, <note place="margin">Humility.</note> which saying he repeated three or four times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon like occasions, reciting at one time that passage of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15. 10. <hi>I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, yet not I, but the grace of God which is in me;</hi> speaking these last words in Greek, as they are in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, giving thereby all the glory to God, without dividing it betwixt himself &amp; his grace, as those which understand that tongue may easily perceive: Afterwards, being laid upon his bed, There is nothing, (said he) more just and reasonable, then that the creature should obey his Creator: Then lifting up his hands above his head, he thrice cryed out, <hi>Mercy,</hi> adding, that he did it to shew, that it was the alone mercy of God to which he had his recourse, and to which we ought to have ours also: That he had heretofore desired to live, in hope to see the deliverance of the Church:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:117874:234"/> But that finding no repentance in the world, he now found nothing that should invite him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it: Then composing his countenance, with a firm and grave voice, he gave his blessing, first unto his daughters, afterwards unto his sons in Law, recommending peace unto them, to which (said he) I leave you, as also to their children, and whole posterity, as well present as absent, praying God to ratifie this his blessing by his most holy benediction; He gave his blessing likewise to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Auberville</hi> his Nephew, and his Wife; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to his Family and houshold servants, and in particular, to the Minister which then assisted him, beseeching the Lord to prosper the holy Ministry of his Word in his hands. He called likewise Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Dissandeau</hi> the Physician, which had always faithfully served him in his sicknesses, particularly in this, and blessed him.</p>
                        <p>At the same time calling to mind Monsieur <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherean,</hi> Minister of the Church in <hi>Saumur,</hi> he prayed God to bless him, and, Let it not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him (said he) to be patient; He hath to do with a troublesom people, I beseech God not to impute their sins unto them; There are some in the company which know what I mean. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by these words those horrible calumnies, with which he had been, especially in his later years, unworthily and outragiously charged at <hi>Saumur,</hi> more then any other place. After he gave his blessing to the Church of <hi>Saumur,</hi> and to that of Saint <hi>Jovin</hi> (which was the neerest to his house) taking notice that there were
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:117874:235"/> in it many good men, which bore affection to the word of God. At length he prayed to God for all the Church in generall, that he would deliver it, and relieve it from oppression, and restore it to a prosperous estate. After which he gave charge to the Minister to write to Madam <hi>de Noiers,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his wife by her former Husband, to tell her, that he gave his blessing to her, and all her houshold: Remembring a while after Madam <hi>de l'Isle</hi> daughter to Monsieur and Madam <hi>de Villar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noul,</hi> he expressed his sorrow for not seeing her, blessing her and her children: As also a while after he blessed particularly such of his grand-children, as did or had followed the studies of Learning, saying, that he was assured they should be blessed with the blessings both of Heaven above, and of the Earth beneath. This being done, he protested that he had through his whole life made Gods glory his end and aim; adding withall, that such as knew him, were not ignorant, that had he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed any other end unto himself, it had been an easie matter for him to have come to great riches &amp; honors. Therupon (the Minister questioning him upon that subject) he declared, That he persisted constantly in the faith wherein he had lived, which also by the grace of God he had defended by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, word, and writings; That were his life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to begin, he would walk in the same way and path, by which he had already steered his course, to wit, by persevering in the profession of the Gospel, notwithstanding the many dis-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which he had suffered for it; That this his
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:117874:235"/> Faith was altogether founded upon the goodness and mercy of God in Christ <hi>Jesus,</hi> who by the Father had been made unto him, and unto all such as believe in him; <hi>Wisdom and righteousness, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and redemption;</hi> And for your works, Sir, (said the Minister unto him) do you attribute no merit at all unto them? Away (answered he) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with all merit both of mine, and of any other mans whatsoever: I call for nothing but mercy, free mercy. Upon which the Minister pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing unto him in the name of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his sins, and the inheritance of eternall life, belonging unto all those that believe in the son of God, saying, that he did it in the vertue and discharge of his duty, not that he at all doubted, but he in his heart fully felt the grace of God, and had full assurance of his mercy; I thank you (said he) for it, and take your saying for an earnest of the goodness of God towards me, and to shew, that what he had said was more then bare words. Monsieur <hi>de Villarnoul,</hi> praising God that he saw him enjoy so much comfort in his end, which he had always heard him to desire during his life, that he might be able to testifie it from his heart, and not die without speaking it; I feel (said he unto him) my Son, I feel what I speak. Afterwards the Minister demanding if he desired that they should pray unto God to fortifie him more and more, and likewise that he would restore him unto his health, that he might further serve him unto his glory. Pray unto God (said he) that he would dispose of me. It being answered, that all hope was not yet
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:117874:236"/> lost, that what had been told him concerning the danger of his present condition, was but for fear least some accident should take away the consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hearing him speak: But that God was Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, able to raise up even those that were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the grave; I am not (said he) an enemy unto life, but I alread see one that is far better then this.</p>
                        <p>A while after, Madam <hi>de Villarnoul</hi> saying unto him, that she hoped God would restore him at the instance of our prayers; My daughter (said he) let him do what he pleases, I depend upon his will. And indeed, though he always testified a great resolution and assurance to encounter with Death, yet he never rejected such remedies, or nourishment as were proffered unto him, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that day dined as he was accustomed: He reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himself from life, he fled it not.</p>
                        <p>After this they prayed by him, during which exercise he was extreamly attentive, his hands and eies following, to their power, the motions of his heart: And as long as the least sense was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he constantly lent a like attention to all the prayers, which at divers times were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto God for him, during the space of those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight hours; so that about five hours before his death, when already motion and sence began to fail him, it was marked, that he endeavoured with one hand to lift the other from under the clothes, that he might hold them joyned and lifted up, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prayer. Prayer being ended, he desired they would read unto him the 71. <hi>Psal.</hi> of which himself made choice; There was likewise read
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:117874:236"/> unto him the Meditation which himself had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time made upon 2 Tim 4. 7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith, &amp;c.</hi> And moreover, by his command ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he had likewise published upon those words of the <hi>Psalmist, Cast thy burthen upon the Lord.</hi> Whilest these were reading, he was very attentive, giving us infinite testimonies of the pleasure which he took in it, and of the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he made from thence for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation. All this during three good hours and above; After which we left him to his repose, as since we alwayes observed the same, to give him some time of rest after that we had heard him. All which spaces he employed in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and holy meditations by himself, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the motions, sighs, and words, which from time to time brake from him, of the assurance which he had in God, of the Victory which by his grace he had obtained against the tempter, and the like. In the afternoon, upon a discourse which was made unto him, of the blessed immortality, the Minister saying, That here below we have but the right and Title, the Possession being reserved for us in heaven, himself cited to this purpose the words of St. <hi>John</hi> in his first Epistle, Chapter the third: <hi>Beloved, now are we the Children of God, but what we shall be doth not yet appear; now we know that when he shall appear we shall be like unto him.</hi> From whence an occasion being given to discourse unto him of the Resurrection, he thought good that they should read unto him the fifteenth chapter of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:117874:237"/> the first of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and marked (so fresh and untroubled was his spirit) upon the forty seventh Verse, <hi>The first man being of the Earth, is of dust</hi> (for so it sounds in the <hi>French</hi> Translation) that it is in the Text <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. About the end of this Lecture, arrived <hi>Madam de la Tabarriere,</hi> his daughter, sent by her husband to visit him, and render the last offices of her Duty to him: He expressed much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in seeing her, saying, that God had granted him that which he desired: That she made up a great part of his comfort, and had done him a great pleasure in coming. He enquired likewise concerning some of her children, which she had not brought with her; and gave her his blessing: Afterwards exhorting all his children in general, to Union and brotherly Love, that they might possess in peace the Inheritance which he should leave unto them; injoyning them in particular, not to go to Law about it; which was promised unto him with great asseverations, by his sons in Law, and daughters, and particularly by <hi>Madam de Fontenay</hi> in the name of her husband then absent in <hi>Normandie:</hi> Which being done, full of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he said, That he was arrived at the height of comfort, since he died with the assurance of leaving peace amongst his children. And as all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired themselves to leave him in repose: How should I sleep (said he) there being so many good people neer me? His daughters then returning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he took them by the hands, saying, That he would speak unto them, and would have them to answer him; And then repeated unto them all
<pb facs="tcp:117874:237"/> the preceding Exhortations, tending to the fear of God, and to Peace and mutual Concord. Some time after the Minister discoursing unto him, That of all his Enemies he had now none left to fear, not Sin, not Death, not the Devil, not the World, being already discomfited by the Lord Jesus, and speaking to each of these in particular, he seemed to take much delight in that discourse: Amongst the rest, as he spoke unto him concerning sin, he said, That its power was the Law, abolished by Christ for such as believe in him; for Death, that it was indeed to be feared of those that are out of Christ, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> (said he in Greek, alluding to a passage in <hi>Aristoles Ethicks,</hi> where death is so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) but not to those that die in the Lord, by whose Cross death was disarmed: As touching the World, the Minister telling him that he knew well by his own experience, how little its tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can prevail against such as the Lord fortifies, his Grace and Mercy having alwayes constantly accompanied him in all his wayes, even to the present hour, which was an assured sign of the faithfulness of his eternal love towards him. He answered, lifting up his eyes on high, Thy Gifts, O God, and thy Call are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And upon that it was said, That the World, to deceive the faithful, sometimes threatens, and sometimes flatters them. These are (said he) the subtilties of Satan. The Minister continuing the same discourse, and shewing, that from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth the Calumnies of the Devil can do nothing against the children of Christ, being justified, and
<pb facs="tcp:117874:238"/> sanctified by faith in him, who is it (cried he out) that shall frame an accusation against the Elect of God? God is he that justifies; Declaring further, that he was fully assured to have part in all his Promises, so that neither life, nor death, things present, nor things to come, should ever be able to seperate him from the love of his Saviour: Which saying, he repeated divers times.</p>
                        <p>The Evening of the same day, upon discourse of the vanity of the world, Alas, (said he) What is the World? It being answered, The World is but a Figure, he added (as it follows in Saint <hi>Paul)</hi> which passeth away: And presently used that expression of <hi>Pindar</hi> in Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. After, leaving this Discourse, he insisted much upon Confession of his sins, Saying, That he was a grievous sinner, even one of the greatest that was upon the earth, That there was in him, as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, the seeds of evil; but that in Jesus Christ he should obtain mercy: And thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired with much affection, that they would speak unto him touching the Death and Passion of our Saviour; which being done, and followed by prayer, he heard all with great Devotion, and at the end of the Prayer, said these words, <hi>Amen,</hi> by Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom all the Promises of God are, <hi>Yea, and Amen.</hi> These were the greatest part of those things in Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith he spent the whole Thursday, and the night following.</p>
                        <p>Friday morning, as we approached to his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, praying him that he would continue to edifie,
<pb facs="tcp:117874:238"/> and comfort us, by the Testimonies of his Faith, and Perseverance: He began with a Prayer, which he pronounced in Latine, <hi>Lord open thou my lips, and I will shew forth thy praise; Lord make me to know my sins, to weep for them, to detest them, to have them in execration,</hi> which he repeated twice; Upon this the Minister took occasion to speak unto him concerning the remission of his sins, and the comfort which follows it, founded upon the hope of immortality, it being impossible that such as are in Christ, though feeble, beaten down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, should yet ever fall from life, the power of the Lord perfecting its self in the midst of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, in such maner, that the inward man was still fortified, as the outward man grew weaker: Citing unto him, and reading all along to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the end of the fourth Chapter of the second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> from the fifteenth Verse, &amp; the beginning of the fifth, to the two and twentieth Verse, laying a particular Emphasis upon these words, <hi>We know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</hi> And asking him if he believed not all these things; If in this Faith he were not assured to be made partaker of that eternall weight of glory, spoken of by the Apostle; He answered; That he was intirely perswaded of it, by the demonstration of the holy spirit, more powerfull, more clear, and more certain then all the demonstrations of <hi>Euclide,</hi> and speaking those words, by the demonstration of the holy Spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:117874:239"/> taken out of the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 4. he repeated them in Greek <gap reason="foreign">

Wherefore he might now say with <hi>Simeon, Nunc dimittis servum tuum in Pace,</hi> upon which he repeated likewise two or three times that of the <hi>Psalmist, I believed, &amp; therfore have I spoken,</hi> applying it as did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. to shew that all his confidence and assurance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his faith. After noon he was heard praying to himself, and saying in broken senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>I flie, I flie to heaven; the Angels carry me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Bosome of my Saviour.</hi> Then the Minister ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and to comfort and confirm him more and more, called to his mind the manifold favours which God had shewed unto him, preserving him from so many dangers which he had run through, fortifying him against so many assaults which he had sustained, having always a particular care over him, and carrying him as the Eagle carries her young ones; which conception he repeated in Latine, <hi>ut Aquila pullitiem suam;</hi> the Minister con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this discourse, he cried out, <hi>Lord thou hast been our refuge in all generations, before the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were brought forth, thou art God.</hi> Whereupon it being added, that as the goodness of God, and his mercy towards us was from everlasting, so is it likewise firm and durable to all eternity: whence he might rest for ever assured of it, nor should the the weakness of his flesh make him any ways to doubt of it; to which he answered, <hi>I know that my</hi>

                           <hi>Redeemer liveth, I shall see him with these eyes; hisce oculis,</hi> repeating these last words in Latine three or four times; And as for the infirmity of the body, which turns into dust; it having been said, that this should not weaken our hope, because that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whose hands we resign it, is powerful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve that trust, that he suffered us to turn as it were into nothing, to raise us up again more gloriously, taking pleasure to magnifie his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in our weakness; of which he had often made experience during his life, and that it was still to be seen in his death, in which by the Lords assistance he triumphed over all his enemies, though in the depth of weakness, according to the flesh. <hi>We can do all things</hi> (answered he) <hi>in Christ that strengthens us.</hi> From that time he still grew weaker, so that towards evening he could no longer pronounce entire periods, nor testifie the motions of his heart, but by short answers to what they demanded of him, conceived in two or three words. Being then asked if he felt not within his soul the force of the holy Spirit sealing unto him the promises of God, and filling him with a lively consolation; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered after a contented manner, which savoured of much cheerfulness, <hi>Yes indeed,</hi> and another time, <hi>I am assured of it,</hi> and a while after, with much ado, <hi>The love of God is in my heart:</hi> always when the Minister asked him how he found himself, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>Very wel.</hi> Thus in the middest of these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thoughts he entred into possession of the true Life, leaving by little and little this other earthly life. His speech failed about midnight, his hearing
<pb facs="tcp:117874:240"/> two hours after, his breath betwixt six and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the morning, at which time he rendred his Spirit unto God his Creator.</p>
                        <p>It is worth our notice, that during these forty eight hours, he felt little or no pain, having been often carefully asked concerning it, almost every hour, always constantly answering, that he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none. Moreover, that he had his senses perfect, as may appear by the preceding discourse, though a day before he had some raving fits, which cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on an instant, without ever returning, so soon as they had given him warning to prepare for the life to come; At which the Physicians much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, seeing his Feaver and long waking (he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been many nights without sleep) in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions should have caused a <hi>Delirium.</hi> Lastly, it must not be forgotten, that in all this time, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained no other discourse then what tended to his salvation, having his judgement, spirits, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in so good estate, that in the middest of his extremities, they could scarce alledge any passage of Scripture, upon which he did not make some note, even upon the Hebrew, Greek and Latine words (whereof we have repeated some) using al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the terms of Scripture to express the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his heart, and accommodating to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent use, the best and richest passages which are there to be found.</p>
                        <p>Of all this, many persons of honour are witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both of ours and the other Religion, which were present there, both the one and the other declaring that they were extreamly edified and
<pb facs="tcp:117874:240"/> comforted by so fair a death: But none of them heard more then Monsieur <hi>Moris,</hi> a Physician of <hi>Bressure,</hi> making profession of the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> who according to his wonted candor, will (I doubt not) always render a faithfull witness to the truth of that which we have here represented; God give them and us grace to make our profit of it, to his glory and our own salvation, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>IOhn Bruen,</hi> of <hi>Bruen-Stapleford,</hi> in the County Palatine of <hi>Chester</hi> Esquire, was born, <hi>An.</hi> 1560. and was the son of a worthy Gentleman, descended of Worshipful Ancestors, who brought him up ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, and as those times were, religiously also: And the Lord preserved him in his childhood, and youth from the poison of Popery, &amp; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:117874:242"/> of those common gross sins, which for want of the light, and life of the Ministry of the Gospel, raigned in those parts: When he was about 7 years old his Father for some offence rebuked him sharply, and corrected him soundly, which he being much grieved at, seeking relief, he took a prayer Book which he had learned, and going into <note place="margin">Seeds of grace.</note> his Fathers Chappel, read in it; and prayed as well as he could, &amp; it pleased the Lord to comfort him with unexpressible joys; the next day he went to the same place, and used the same means, but found not the like comfort: Afterwards his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sent him to his Uncles, Master <hi>Dutton</hi> of <hi>Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> where he was bred up at School, under one <note place="margin">His Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Master <hi>James Roe,</hi> for about three years space: <hi>Anno</hi> 1577. his Father sent him to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he first received the love of the truth in any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and understanding, being then about seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, he lived in <hi>Albans-Hall</hi> as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Commoner, and being familiar with one <hi>John Breerwood,</hi> his Countriman, an Aldermans son of <hi>Chester:</hi> This <hi>Breerwood</hi> observing in him some Popish practises, and opinions, set upon him by Scripture arguments to convince and reform him, whereupon this young Gentleman (through Gods mercy) was so wrought upon, that as himself <note place="margin">Conversion.</note> wrote it down in his Book; <hi>I was,</hi> saith he, <hi>then inflamed with zeal against the prophane beast of Rome, and all Popery, both persons and things, with all their Monuments, Rites, and Ceremonies, &amp;c.</hi> After a while his Father sent for him home, that he might dispose of him in marriage, and provided for him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:117874:242"/> the daughter of one Mr. <hi>Hardware</hi> [a worthy and wise Gentleman] to whom he was married with the consent of Parents, and in the fear of God, <note place="margin">Marriage.</note> and lived very comfortably with her for seventeen years, seeing his sons, and daughters as Olive plants round about his Table: Then being in the prime of his youth, he spent too much time in hawking, hunting, and such carnall delights. But <hi>Anno,</hi> 1587. his Father dying, he began to be much perplexed both in mind and estate; some sorrows and fears, thoughts and cares began to stir, and work in him, and the Lord hereby began to work for his more effectuall calling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and this he did both by the rebukes of his Word, and checks of his Spirit, convincing his <note place="margin">Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> judgement, and changing his heart from the love of baser, to a delight in better things: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he began to search his heart, and try his ways, and to call himself to an account for his former courses, and weighing them in the ballance of the Sanctuary, he found them to be but vanity, and vexation of spirit: and besides, he being charged by his Father with the portions of twelve chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which he left behind him, he began to cut off occasions of wastfull and riotous expences; and whereas his Father left him a Park well furnished with Deer, he disparked it, and drawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">Frugality.</note> to as narrow a compass as he well could, he provided competently and comfortably for his own Family, and faithfully payed his Brethren and Sisters all their portions, and disposed of them in marriage to their own content: Then he was
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:117874:243"/> very careful to set up Gods worship in his Family, walking wisely in the midst of his house, setting <note place="margin">Family go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> his eyes, his favour upon the godly, and not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering a wicked person to abide in his sight: and his principall care was to dwell with his Wife as a man of knowledge, and to train up his children in the nurture, and information of the Lord, and by his holy and prudent carriage his wife (though well affected to Religion before) yet grew on to an higher pitch in knowledge, and grace, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came to him a faithfull helper, and carefull yoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, to bear and draw in the yoak of Christ: they were both very carefull in the education of their children, catechising of them in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">Education of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> of Religion, and causing them to learn such sentences of Scriptures as might make the easiest impression of grace upon their hearts: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he spare to use the rod of correction, as Gods healing medicine to cure the corruptions of his children, yet if at any time his heart was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated through his hatred of sin, and zeal for Gods glory, that he spake unadvisedly with his lips, or dealt too violently with his hands, he used to be much humbled for it, that going about to cure others, he had wounded himself: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his man and maid servants, there was not one idle and unprofitable person: and for his choice of servants, he took notice of any therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, that began to set their faces towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, such he loved, and laboured to draw them into his service: So that in a short time he was furnished with godly and gracious servants, both
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:117874:243"/> men, and maids: and then he looked upon them as his brethren, and fellow servants in, and under Christ: would sometimes use them famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, advise, confer, consult, and resolve with them in matters of conscience, and other weighty occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: Sometimes he made them his comforters in afflictions, and tentations, and received refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them: Amongst the rest, he had one old disciple <hi>[Robert Pasfield]</hi> a man utterly unlearned, being able neither to write nor read, yet through <note place="margin">Old <hi>Robert.</hi>
                        </note> Gods blessing upon his industry, having a good memory, he became ripe in understanding, and mighty in the Scriptures: Yea, he was so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the summ, and substance of every Book and Chapter, that hardly could a man ask him for any sentence of Scripture, but he would tell him in what Book and Chapter he might find it: He had a good gift in prayer, was very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and able to confer of good things, whereby he became very usefull both in the Family, and to other young Christians abroad, as he had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity: For the help of his memory he invented, and framed a girdle of Leather, long and large, which went twice about him: this he divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to severall parts, allotting every Book in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their order to some of these divisions, then for the Chapters, he affixed points or thongs of Leather to the severall divisions, and made knots by fives or tens, therupon to distinguish the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Book; and by other points he divided the Chapters into their particular Contents or Verses, as occasion required: This he used in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:117874:244"/> of pen, and ink, in hearing Sermons, and made so good use of it, that coming home, he was able by it to repeat the Sermon, quote the texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, &amp;c. to his own great comfort, and to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others; which girdle Master <hi>Bruen</hi> kept after his death, hung it up in his Study, and would merrily call it, the <hi>Girdle of verity:</hi> This old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> (though but a servant, yet) being rich in grace, his Master used him very familiarly; when conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently he could, he would have him neer him, would often go to the Hop-yard or Barn, where his business lay, to talk and confer with him, and when he was grown old, having been in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice about thirty years, he was so far from casting him off, that he daily fed him with some of the best morsels from his own Table, and setting him not far from him, that he might the better confer with him, which he continued to his dying day: Such other servants as he chose to be ever about him at home, and abroad, he made happy, by his taking opportunities to impart some wholsome <note place="margin">His carriage to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> words of admonition, &amp; instruction to them, &amp;c. He never thought his Table better furnished, then when he had some godly persons to sit with him, or stand about him, nor his meat better seasoned, then when it was poudred with the salt of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some words: And for other of his servants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Husbandry, and such out-works, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffered them to want such encouragements as might make them cheerfull in his, and Gods service: He would sometimes go abroad to them, raise matter of speech, and conference from their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:117874:244"/> callings, works, wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their instruction and edification: And there were few of them but exercised themselves unto godliness, praying in their courses every night in the Kitchin, when their Master was gone to bed: Such of his Servants as were inclined to Marriage, he provided well for them.</p>
                     <p>The religious duties which he daily, and duly <note place="margin">His private, and Family Duties.</note> performed in his Family, Morning and Evening, were these: He rose very early every morning, before any in the Family, betwixt three and four a clock in the Summer, and at five in the Winter, and then spent an hour or two in private, before he rang the Bell to awaken the rest of his Family: In his secret prayers, he used to make mention of every one in his Family, and especially as their occasions, and afflictions required, and gave thanks for such mercies, as either he, or they had received: Then he meditated upon some part of Gods Word, or Works, where with he seasoned his mind in the morning: Then he wrote out fair, part of some Sermon that he had heard lately before: Then his Family being up, and met together, he, with his heart, and his hands lift up to heaven, speak in this manner,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Blessed Lord God, and our most merciful Father in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A form of Prayer.</note>
                        <hi>Christ Jesus, We thy poor children do humbly beseech thee graciously to assist us by thy holy Spirit in this our morning Exercise, that we may faithfully perform the same to thy praise, and our comfort, and that for Christ his sake, our onely Saviour and Redeemer: Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:117874:245"/>
                     <p> This set form of short prayer he used morning and evening before his Exercise, to convince their ignorance, which deny the lawfulness of them: Then he, with his Family, sung a Psalm, with <note place="margin">Spiritual joy.</note> which Exercise he was much delighted, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes so ravished therewith in his Spirit, that his heart would even spring, and leap in his body: Yea, he was so affected with praising of God: That he took the word <hi>Hallelujah</hi> for his Motto, and usually wrote it in the first Page of all his Books: Then he read a Chapter himself out of the Bible in order: Then himself also prayed with them, and that with such power, feeling, fervency, sincerity, faith, and humility, that he was oft much admired of them that heard him: He so wrestled <note place="margin">His fervent prayers.</note> with God by prayers and tears, that he would not let him go, till he had prevailed, insomuch that they seldom met again to pray, but he had some new and fresh cause of thanksgiving for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of his prayers. In the Evening he called them together again to the like service, which he performed very religiously after the same maner, saving that after the Chapter he propounded some wholsom instructions to them, as the portion of Scripture gave occasion, whether to convince any Error, or to confirm the Truth, to rebuke sin, or to instruct in the way of righteousness, &amp;c. And the better to justifie this his practise against opposers, he made collections out of the Sacred Scriptures, <note place="margin">Note.</note> out of the Expositions, Testimonies, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of godly and good men, concerning this point of the Masters Duty, in teaching, and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:117874:245"/> his Family in the fear of God, and faith of Christ: And lest any should think that hereby he intrenched too much upon the Ministers Office, and went beyond his line; they must know, that whatsoever he spake in this kind, he borrowed it of good men, or obtained it by serious Study and Meditation, got it by reading the Scriptures, and good Expositors, or by reviewing his Notes of such Sermons as he had heard upon those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, using all good and holy means to fit and furnish himself with spiritual provisions for that service: Neither was his zeal confined within his own walls: For finding in the Church of <hi>Tarvin,</hi> and his own Chappel that anciently belonged to him, <note place="margin">Zeal against Idolatry.</note> many superstitious Images in the windows, which by their painted coats darkned the light of the Church, and obscured the brightness of the Gospel, he caused all those painted Puppets to be pulled down in a peaceable maner, and at his own cost glazed the windows again: And for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and justification, he had not onely the Word of God, but the Queens injunctions authorizing, and requiring the same: And his heart was so inlarged towards God, with zeal for his glory, and his peoples good, that it was the joy <note place="margin">Zeal for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating the Gospel.</note> of his soul to bring in godly and able Ministers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them almost every Lords Day into the publike Assembly, and that of his own cost, and labour, which he did with a cheerful heart, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noring God with his substance, by giving main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to such as were the Lords Labourers in his Harvest: And though many sleighted it, yet
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:117874:246"/> was it no discouragement to him, neither was he weary of wel-doing: Whose practise will shame such, as being intrusted with the lands, and livings of the Church for the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, <note place="margin">Sacriledge abhorred.</note> do turn their Patronage into Pillage, and their Devotion into Sacriledge, robbing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of their means, and the people of their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall provision.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. Having provided for his Parish a worthy Preacher, the people, though they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his gifts, yet would not so much as thank him for his pains, which was a great discouragement to the Minister: Hereupon Master <hi>Bruen</hi> withdrew <note place="margin">He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the ministry for a while.</note> his Preacher into his own Chappel, to make the people more to prize the Word by the want of it: Then resorted many to him, some to the Chapel to feed their souls, and many into the Hall to feed their bellies, to his no small cost, and yet great comfort, because Religion increased thereby: But after a while, at the importunity of Christian friends he restored him to the publike Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maintaining him, and other Preachers after him, till by the death of the Incumbent, God esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished a faithful Pastor amongst them. And <note place="margin">My reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend, and learned bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Master Sabbath Clark.</note> whereas the people at <hi>Tarvin</hi> had a bad custom of keeping Wakes upon the Sabbath Day, at which times there was much profaneness practised, to the dishonor of God, by banqueting, drinking, dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This godly Gentleman studying to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy <note place="margin">Wakes put down.</note> this great evil, against that time, every year, provided three of the best affected Ministers in the Country, who spent most part of three dayes in
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:117874:246"/> preaching and praying in the Church, so that the Pipers, Fidlers, Bearwards, Players, and Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters had no time left them for their vanities, but went away with great fretting, yet multitudes of welaffected people filled the Town, &amp; the Church, much rejoycing before God; and these he feasted at his house also, so that at one of these times, he spent in his house a fat Beef, and a half in the <note place="margin">Liberality.</note> space of three dayes upon godly, and welaffected people: And this he did for divers years together, till by degrees, he had weared out those profane Wakes: Hereupon he began to be admired for his fervency in the profession of the Gospel, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise <note place="margin">His house a nursery of Religion.</note> of true Religion, insomuch that divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the best rank desired to sojourn in his house, for their better information in the way of God: One of which at his first coming would by no means indure to be reproved for his faults, but how it was afterwards with him, Master <hi>Bruen</hi> thus left it upon Record; <hi>After a while, having the one hundred forty first Psalm for our Evening Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, divers of my Family did usually give notes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing godly and welaffected, and they all concluded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that every one of them should speak upon the fifth verse. Let the righteous reprove me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And my self gave the last note, after which he never resisted any more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And whereas in those days the Lord was pleased in compassion to his people, to raise up, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish many holy exercises of Religion in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> and <hi>Lancashire,</hi> which were maintained monthly by the godly labors of the faithfull Ministers of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:117874:247"/> Christ in those parts with much comfortable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: Master <hi>Bruen</hi> frequented these exercises, and <note place="margin">His pains to hear the Word.</note> with great care, and conscience, he stored himself with their treasures, and lighted his Candle at their Torches, whereby he was better enabled, and more furnished to set forwards Religion in his Family, and elsewhere, as occasion was offered: In frequenting these exercises, he took much pains, riding early and late, in heat and cold, and through foul ways, sometimes ten, twenty, yea thirty miles, to his great charges also: These Sermons he wrote diligently, repeated them as he went home, and for about thirty six years together at home he wrote over again the substance of these exercises, whereby he left to the heirs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily so many Volumnes of Manuscripts set up orderly in his Study, as is scarce credible, which he charged them to read over, if it were but once in their lives: He used the Ministers wheresoever he came marvellous kindly, commending their pains, <note place="margin">His love to Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> rejoycing in their labors, and many times defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their charges; always encouraging them with gracious and sweet words: Yea, this kindness of of his extended to all the professors of Religion, even to the weakest and poorest Christian that he observed to frequent these exercises: In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of these sweet comforts the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to exercise him with a great affliction, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away with a stroak his dear Wife, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yoak-fellow, yet did the Lord so sanctifie this <note place="margin">His Wife dies.</note> affliction to him, that by the power of grace, and Christian wisdom, he moderated his affections,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:117874:247"/> and subdued his passions, not mourning as a man without hope, but assuring himself that his loss was her gain: after which, finding that he stood in need of marriage for the comfort of his life, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of his family, he sought by prayer a prudent wife from God; and the Lord was pleased to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his prayers by providing for him Mistris <hi>Ann Fox,</hi> descended of an ancient and worshipfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily <note place="margin">His second Marriage.</note> in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> a Gentlewoman as beautifull by grace within, as amiable in face without, and one very well reported of in the Church of God: Her therefore, with the joynt consent of her self, and friends, he married, and the first year her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would needs give them their Table, during which time he was as carefull to do good to that Family, as if it had been his own house, and <note place="margin">He promotes Religion in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> he quickned himself and them to Prayer, and Praise, Reading the Scripture, Singing of Psalms, holy Conference, Catechising, &amp;c. Concerning which, himself thus writes: <hi>My Mother in Law Tabling of us for a year, we set up the exercises of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion morning and evening; In which time through Gods grace, my Mother in Law got saving grace, and my Sister in Law, now Mistris</hi> Hinde, <hi>and another half Sister of hers, and their Brothers, Master</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, <hi>and Master</hi> Thomas Fox, <hi>a servant or two, and some neighbours, blessed be God for it, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>At the years end, he brought home his beloved Wife to <hi>Stapleford,</hi> where they lived in great peace and love; and being well setled, there were many of the greatest Gentlemen in the Country that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, some for themselves, some for their

                        <hi>Certainly this is no other then the house of God, and for the practise and power of Religion, the very Topsail of</hi> England: His Fame spreading still more and more, many Gentlemen sought to him, to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ with him, and at the requests of his friends he entertained divers Families, and personages of great place; many of which, during their abode with him, were truly converted, others convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and all much reformed in their lives: But in

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:117874:250"/> time it pleased the Lord Almighty to give a great blessing, All praise to his holy Name: Many converted, many confirmed, and many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced: In these three years God also gave me a great blessing in my outward estate: I paid all my <note place="margin">God blesseth him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</note> debt: I married two of my daughters, and paid their portions: I preferred a son or two: I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the poor in my own Parish in the Country, allowing them all the profit of my two Mils: I <note place="margin">Charity.</note> maintained the poor in <hi>Chester,</hi> both at my Gates, and otherwise weekly, as I was rated: All humble and hearty thanks be given unto God, Father, Son, and holy Ghost, for evermore, Amen.</p>
                     <p>The three years being expired, he returned home to <hi>Stapleford,</hi> and incouraging himself in the wayes of God: He daily performed these four Duties: First, Meditation for the increase of Knowledge, and good affections towards God, <note place="margin">Meditation.</note> and good things: And for his help herein, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about with him some part of the Bible, or Notes of Sermons when he went into the Fields: Within doors he read much in the Scriptures, and made collections of the Promises, Preceps, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, Prohibitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these he made the subject of his Meditations: For this end also he read oft the Works of divers Learned men, and drew into Heads, and Commonplaces what was most worthy Observation in them: And he found much benefit by these Meditations: as the killing <note place="margin">The fruits of it.</note> of noisom lusts, the dislodging of many worldly cares: It wrought in him a godly care over his thoughts, words, and actions: A gratious aptness

                     <p>Some few years before my Brother <hi>Hardware</hi> died, he had a Man-servant (as many thought) bewitched, and grew daily weaker and weaker, so that my bother sent to me, and my Family to spend a day with him in Fasting and Prayer: At that time I had good Master <hi>Wats</hi> the Preacher with me, we went to the house, where we found the man very sick and weak, and like an Anatomy, having nothing but skin and bones, not like to live a day longer: He was brought and layed in a bed in the Chamber where we prayed, and the same Evening he began to amend: The next <note place="margin">Return of Prayer.</note> morning he walked abroad, and the third day was so strong, that he fell to his work and labour: <hi>All laud, and praise to God for it.</hi>

                     <p>But he took the greatest pains in Recording the passages about a Boy about twelve years old at <note place="margin">A Boy pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with the Devil.</note>
                        <hi>Northwitch,</hi> who was so strangely, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully afflicted and tormented, that many held him to be really possessed with the Devil; about this he wrote much; Some of the passages were these: By his torments he was brought so low, weak, and feeble, that he was almost nothing but skin and bones, yet for the space of four and twenty hours every day (having one half hour respite, which they called his awaking time, and wherein they gave him a little food) he was of that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strength, that if he foulded his hands together,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:117874:251"/> no man could pull them asunder: If he rolled his head, or tossed his whole body (as usually he did) no man could stay, or restrain him: He would, to the great astonishment of the hearers, howl like a Dog, mew like a Cat, roar like a Bear, froth like a Boar: When any prayed with him, his passions were strongest, and his rage, and violence greatest, ready to fly in their faces, and to drown their voyces by his yellings, and out-cries: If one came near him with a Bible, though under his Cloak, and never so secret, he would run upon him, and use great violence to get it from him, and when he could get any, he rent them in pieces: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would lie along, as if he had been stark dead, his colour gone, and mouth so wide open, that he would on a sudden thrust both his hands into it: And notwithstanding his great weakness, he would leap and skip from his Bed to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, from the Window to the Table, and so to bed again, and that with such agility, as no Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler could do the like: And yet all this while his legs were grown up close to his buttocks, so that he could not use them; sometimes we saw his chin drawn up to his Nose, that his mouth could scarce be seen: sometimes his chin and forehead drawn almost together like a bended Bow: his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance fearfull by yawning, mowing, &amp;c. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop hearing of the strange torments of this poor child, sent for him: His parents brought him, and once the Bishop prayed with him, but the boy was so outragious, that he flew out of his bed, and so frighted the Bishops men, that one of them fell
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:117874:252"/> into a sown, and the Bishop was glad to lay hold on the boy, who ramped at the window to have gotten out: Hereupon this Bishop granted a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense for a private fast in the childs fathers House for his help and release: which accordingly was performed by two godly Ministers, &amp; by Master <hi>Bruen,</hi> with divers others; yet God gave not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance at that time: when he was in his fits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out understanding and knowledge of what he did or said, he would often say,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jesus</hi> saith, (for so he began all his speeches) the Devil when he comes takes away my hearing, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, understanding, hands, legs, that I should have no senses, nor limbs to glorifie God withall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jesus</hi> saith, If they would have cast out the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill spirit, they should have come better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jesus</hi> saith, I have but three Devils: Its like one of the Spirits will go out of me, and take counsel of a great number of foul Spirits, and come again, and trouble me worse.</p>
                     <p>God puls back the Devil with a ring in his nose, yet the Devil shakes my Faith, as if it would go out of me.</p>
                     <p>Well, these Drunkards and Whoremasters do not think upon their sins: Well, how then? there is no Drunkard that doth drink one spoonfull, or drop of drink more then will suffice nature, but the Devill doth pen it down in his book: Well, it is a great Book, and he doth keep it close till the Day of Judgement, and then he will lay it to their faces, at which time the hils will tremble and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:117874:252"/> quake, and the Devil will quake, yea, he doth quake for fear already.</p>
                     <p>Well, some would think it a great while to be bound with the Devil a year or two, as I am; but its better to be so, then to wallow in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, swearing and whoring: for the Devil works in their souls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Jesus</hi> saith, They say he shall not out of me: but when God comes he will strike home.</p>

                     <p>Master <hi>Bruen,</hi> besides his Family duties mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before, used private prayer very often, yet not confining himself to any place within, or without <note place="margin">Private du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> doors for it, but taking his fittest opportunity, as time, and place best accorded: About his own house he had divers places which interchangeably he used for this purpose, not frequenting one, lest he should be suspected of hypocrisie, or vain-glory; &amp; as he was choice of the place, so of the time also, which he constantly set apart every day for private prayer: Seven times a day did he practise this duty; <note place="margin">He prayed seven times a day.</note> first, in the morning before any of his family rose; next after family prayer, before his breakfast; then immediately before Dinner; then a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner; then a little before Supper; then not long after Supper: Lastly, a little before he went to bed: And as he was frequent, so was he, through Gods grace, powerfull in these his prayers: and hereunto, upon extraordinary occasions, he added fasting, which he observed with so great austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:117874:253"/> that he much weakned his body thereby; and <note place="margin">Fasting.</note> as it is recorded of Saint <hi>James</hi> the Apostle, so was it true of this Gentleman, that his knees were grown very senceless, and hard with much and <note place="margin">He used to kneel upon the bare boards.</note> frequent kneeling: In these his private prayers his principall aim was to search his heart, examine his life, confess and bewail his speciall sins, and infirmities, craving pardon for them, and power against them; as also for the sins or afflictions in his Family: he mourned for the sins of <hi>Sion,</hi> and for the afflictions of <hi>Joseph,</hi> and desolations of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi> he afflicted his heart for the barrenness and backsliding of professors, for their imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the world, forsaking their first love: to which he added, praise, and thanksgiving for mercies: He daily laboured to be more and more renewed in the spirit of his mind, in knowledge, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and holiness, according to the Image of him <note place="margin">His heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> that created him: Whilst his commoration was on earth, his conversation was in Heaven: He had an holy resolution, so to use the world, as neither abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it, nor being abused by it, but to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unspotted from it: He had a full purpose to keep his heart always in Gods presence, knowing and believing that he heard all his words, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held all his works: He used a constant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable <note place="margin">His univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> striving against all sin, especially the sins of the times and places wherein he lived: He had a godly desire in all companies either to do good to others, or to receive good from others: a full purpose to deal justly, and uprightly with all men, doing no other to them, then he would have
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:117874:253"/> them do to him: a charitable disposition to take doubtfull things in the best sence, so far as he <note place="margin">Charity.</note> might, without wounding his own conscience, or offending others: He was slow to speak, swift to hear: He utterly renounced the vain conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the world, neither following the fashions, nor serving the humors of vain, or vile persons, <note place="margin">Hated sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fashions.</note> nor staying in their company longer then needs must: His care was to cut off all occasions of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and strife, with all speed that might be: He laboured for an holy contentedness of mind, by entertaining all crosses with patience, and turning them to their best use, and imbracing all comforts with thanksgiving, bringing forth the right &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fruits of them: He would not be easily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by indignities, and injuries, he had rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give <note place="margin">Meekness.</note> twenty wrongs, then revenge one: He was willing to purchase his peace, sometimes with his own loss, if otherwise he could not procure it: He used to shut his ears against tale-bearers, the seedsmen of strife, and firebrands of contention; Ordinarily he recompenced evill with good, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness with kindness, and passion with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and good affection: A neighbour Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Note.</note> conceiving a great displeasure against him upon a very small occasion, in a great ruff sent his man to him to inhibit him from coming upon his land, either himself, or any of his Family, upon their perill; To whom Master <hi>Bruen</hi> presently answered; Tell your Master from me, that if he, or any of his Family will come upon any part of <note place="margin">Returns good for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</note> my ground at their pleasures, they shall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:117874:254"/> and if he will come to my house, he shall be much more welcome; which gracious and kind answer did so melt the heart of his adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he presently brake forth into tears, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled himself to him, and became his true and faithfull friend ever after: He was also very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent or remove all occasions of variance, and strife amongst neighbours, and friends, both neer and far from home.</p>
                     <p>Naturally he was passionate, and hasty, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Grace over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> his sin pardoned in the bloud of Christ, and having gotten power over it, his nature was healed, his passions subdued, and his frowardness was changed into mildness: He was of an ingenuous facility, either to be perswaded to any thing that was good, or to be disswaded from any thing that was evill: An honorable Judge in open Court having a complaint made to him against M. <hi>Bruen,</hi> of some wrong that he did, by a Water course to his Mils: Out of that good opinion he held of him, said: <hi>I cannot think but that you wrong Mr.</hi> Bruen, <hi>I will undertake for him, make him but sensible of any</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of him.</note>
                        <hi>wrong that he hath done, and he shall willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, and make you double amends for it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Also there was forty shillings given to the Parish of <hi>Tarvin,</hi> which being lent abroad, through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, was lost, whereupon the Church-wardens, and some of the neighbours requested him by <note place="margin">Liberality.</note> himself and his friends to make it up again, to which he presently answered, that he would not press upon any mans purse for that matter, &amp; so he gave them the mony himself, which though not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:117874:254"/> much, yet more then most Gentlemen would have have done in such a case: He saw none that were without the means of grace, but the bowels of compassion yerned in him, pitying the misery that was upon them: He saw none occasionally at their heathenish sports, and sinfull pastimes, but he looked angerly upon them, and spake roughly <note place="margin">Mercy.</note> to them, yet withall, inwardly mourning for the hardness of their hearts: If occasionally he met with mockers, contemners of God, and dispisers of good things, he would not cast pearls before swine, but turn away his face, and not so much as salute them: If any poor soul erred from the right way, and yet desired a guide; how carefull was he of their good? How joyfull to do them good? yea, to encourage and draw on such, he would give them Mony, Corn, Bibles, Catechismes and other good Books, which he had always by him for such purposes: If a professor of Religion fell into decay, he would relieve him by his own, and other good means: Sometimes he would take off <note place="margin">Charity.</note> a good sute of apparel from his own back, and bestow it upon a godly poor man that wanted it, and withall give him a good summ of mony out of his purse to accommodate him in his calling: He was much given to Hospitality, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain strangers; his house was the common Inn of Gods children that came neer him: None so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to eat of his morsels as such strangers, as were no strangers in <hi>Israel:</hi> Many that passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Ireland</hi> &amp; <hi>England,</hi> and that came upon busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>Choster,</hi> horsemen and others; would take
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:117874:255"/> up his house for their lodging place, that they <note place="margin">His hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> might comfort and rejoyce their hearts in seeing his face, hearing his voice, and conferring and advising with him: His ordinary Table was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and plentifull, not to excess, but to a very competent sufficiency, and for the furtherance of it, he had a great flight of Pigeons, a Warren of Conies, delicate Fish-ponds, besides other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary provision about his house: Yet would he not suffer any wilfull wast or abuse of Gods good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: His Cellar was open, and free to any, as far as they kept themselves within the bounds of moderation: He did usuall fill the bellies of great multitudes, which out of his own and other <note place="margin">Charity.</note> parishes resorted to him for that end: And in the deer years he made provision for them almost eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in the week, &amp; would sometimes serve them himself; both to keep them in good order, and equally to distribute according to their necessities: His purse was ever open to give, or lend freely to such as would borrow: his admonition was, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your promise, and pay again if you will borrow again:</hi> and if any that borrowed were willing, but not able to pay, he would rather forgive the debt then exact it.</p>
                     <p>In the time of a great dearth, fearing that divers of his poor neighbors were in want, taking the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity when most of his Family were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to a religious Exercise, he sent for his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and distributed fourteen Bushels of Corn amongst them: Yea, the loyns of the poor did bless him, being warmed with the fleece of his
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:117874:255"/> flock, or clothed by the cost of his purse: Every year against Winter, he bestowed four or five pound in making provision to clothe the poor: <note place="margin">His Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> Yea, he was a protector to the poor, to deliver him out of the hands of those that were too strong for them: He was a Counsellor to defend their righteous cause, and to plead for them.</p>
                     <p>He held always a gracious Harmony in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all such Divines, and Professors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as were most sound in the Truth: He religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sympathised with the Church in all her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p>When he heard evil tidings out of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sympathy.</note>
                        <hi>Hungary, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> &amp;c. he sat down (as <hi>Nehemiah)</hi> and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven: He was frequent in visiting the sick, and such Families as had the extraordinary hand of God upon them: If any were troubled in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, molested by Satan, terrified by Gods Judgements, happy was he that could get Master <hi>Bruen</hi> come to him, his very presence was some ease and refreshing to them: And as his gifts in prayer, and pains were great, so was the issue, and <note place="margin">Prayer pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull.</note> success thereof (through Gods Blessing) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times very effectual, either for full release, or some relief at least: He himself Recorded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers mercies obtained of God by his Prayers, the glory whereof he doth ever in great humility ascribe to the Lord, giving him hearty thanks for manifesting his Grace and Power to so weak crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by so weak means: Being on a time at the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:117874:256"/> Sheriffs Table, there was a Health begun to the Prince, and there were great Lords present, but <note place="margin">Zeal.</note> when it came to Master <hi>Bruen,</hi> he said, You may drink to his Health, and I will pray for his health, but drink for mine own health, and so I wish you may do for yours, and so he passed it over, not yielding to any of the solemn Ceremonies in that act: He was a great enemy to the profane Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and corruptions used in great Houses, and would not spare to admonish his friends, by word or writing to reform the same.</p>
                     <p>He was very merciful in his dealing with his <note place="margin">Mercy.</note> Tenants, not grinding the faces of the poor by great Fines, nor crushing their bones by heavy rents, and racks, nor break their backs with cruel services, nor did he use their beasts without hire, nor their labour without wages: But it was the joy of his heart to see his Tenants prosper: His whole <note place="margin">Death pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for.</note> life was a meditation of death, and a continual preparation for it: And in his declining dayes, when he saw that he was drawing on towards his journeys end, his faith was exceedingly increased, his hope, and rejoycing in God much inlarged, his love and zeal wonderfully inflamed, his affections towards God and his people more holy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and his motions towards heaven more quick and lively then before: The day before his last sickness, he rose very early in the morning, went into his Study to his private prayer, then came forth and prayed with his Family, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into his Study till Dinner time: and after Dinner went into his Study again, where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:117874:256"/> God after two hours to visit him, as it were, with an Ague, whereupon he laid himself down upon a bed: His wife said to him, Sir, I fear you have done your self hurt with rising so early; to whom he replied; If you had seen, wife, such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <note place="margin">Joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> things as I saw this morning, being in private prayer with God, you would not have said so, for they were so wonderful and unspeakable, that whether I was in the body or out of the body, with <hi>Paul,</hi> I cannot tell, thus it hath pleased God, lest I should be too much exalted by this glorious sight, to give me a buffet in the flesh: The like ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing in spirit, and such glorious sights, he saw not long before (as he acquainted some private friends) after he had been one day in private prayer with God in his Grove: Whence he had a strong perswasion, that he should not live long, before he made a glorious change of this life, with a better: And for this end he cleared up his Evidences for heaven, and confirmed his assurance of his right thereunto: This his confidence was <note place="margin">Faith.</note> his comfort in all his sickness, which drew from him many such heavenly speeches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O how great is thy goodness, O Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee, before the sons of men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>O how precious are thy thoughts to me, O God! O how great is the summ of them! If I should count them, they are more in number then the sand: When I awake I am ever with thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory: Whom have I in heaven but thee?</hi>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:117874:257"/>
                        <hi>And there is none on earth that I desire besides thee: my flesh and my heart faileth, but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever: I know whom I have believed, and I am perswaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day: O love the Lord all ye his Saints, for the Lord preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the faithfull, &amp;c: As the hart panteth after the water Brooks, so panteth my heart after thee O God: My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: O when shall I come and appear before God: O let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, for thy love is better then wine, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These, and many hundred more of these Divine speeches did he utter in the time of his sickness; and though his bodily infirmity grew upon him, yet would he by no means be kept from the house of God, so long as he could either go or ride: and <note place="margin">His house was a mile from the Church.</note> when he went to Church, besides his Family, he used to call his Tenants, and neighbours that dwelt in his way, to go along with him, and then calling them about him, they used with one heart and voice to sing Psalms, especially the 84. <hi>Psal.</hi> and he with his train came to Church constantly before prayers, and Divine Service began, that he <note place="margin">How he spent the Sabbath.</note> might the more comfortably joyn with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in the confession of sin, in prayer, praise, reading, singing, hearing, receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all which he performed with most reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend attention, and gracious affection: After the Morning Sermon he usually stayed in the Church amongst other good people, and spent the time in repeating the Sermon, singing of Psalms, and holy
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:117874:257"/> conference: after Evening Sermon he returned home, attended with his company with much joy, and endeavouring as they went to encrease their knowledge, faith, obedience, &amp;c. In his Family he was so full of life and zeal, that many that lived neer him, came to hear him repeat the Sermons, and power out his prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; and the joy and comfort that he found in these duties were such, that he would often say, <hi>O that every day were a Sabbath, or a Fast day, for then I should be well:</hi> The week days were <note place="margin">His last sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> more tedious to him, his bodily infirmity encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and his strength decaying; yet would he quicken his soul, and raise up his heart by faith and hope, often saying; <hi>The time is not long, I must shortly lay down this my Tabernacle, and then I shall get the start of you all, and shall celebrate and everlasting Sabbath before the Lord, with his holy Angels, and blessed Saints, in the highest heavens:</hi> He grew daily more &amp; more weary of the world: He set his house in order, and then wholly set himself to think and speak of spirituall and heavenly things: when any came to visit him, he would often say, <hi>Alas good souls, what are you come to see, a poor wretch, a worm, and no man, or a poor dying man, &amp;c.</hi> and when any told him of hopes of recovery, he would say, <hi>My task is ended, the Lord hath no more work for me to do, my warfare is accomplished, my race is run out, I now onely hope, and wait for that Crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to his friends.</note>
                        <hi>which Christ hath purchased, and God hath promised to me:</hi> To his Christian friends he would give these admonitions, to hold on, and to hold
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:117874:258"/> out, to be stedfast in their professions, not to be weary of well doing, to grow in grace, &amp;c. And for their greater incouragement, he would tell them, that when he first began to profess Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there were almost none in the whole Shire that were acquainted with the power and practise of it, &amp;c. <hi>I was,</hi> said he, <hi>a wonder of the world, and a monster of men, and many did bend their tongues like bows for lyes, &amp; did shoot their arrows, even bitter words against me, and yet for all this that came upon me, I did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the name of my God, &amp;c. But (blessed be God) the number of believers, in this Country is much enlarged, every quarter and corner of it being filled with the sweet savour of the Gospel, &amp;c. Therefore my deerly beloved, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong, be stedfast and unmovable, &amp;c.</hi> Also, though his affliction and sickness encreased, yet were not his consolations diminished, though he was fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the flesh, yet strong in the Spirit: no pains of his body, nor pangs of approaching death did half so much trouble him, as the inward refreshings of <note place="margin">Comfort in affliction.</note> Gods holy Spirit did make his consolations to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: Afterwards his weakness increased by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a stopping in his breast, &amp; throat, so that he could not take down any liquid thing, but he was ready to faint away: About this time a worthy Knight coming to visit him, could not refrain from many tears, which he observing, said to him, <hi>Good</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Henry Bunbury.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>Sir, weep not for me, for there is no cause of weeping, but of much rejoycing in my behalf; turn your tears into prayers, &amp; let me enjoy that fruit of your love, &amp;c. you are in your way, I am at my journeys end, walk on</hi>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:117874:258"/>
                        <hi>as hitherto you have done, and the Lord will be with you, he will never fail you, nor forsake you:</hi> To his eldest son he gave many wholsom instructions, <note place="margin">His charge to his son.</note> and gracious exhortations, praying for him, and blessing his children, encouraging them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in Religion, commanding them to uphold the worship and service of God, both in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Assembly, and private Family.</p>
                     <p>A little before his death, there came two godly <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>L.</hi>
                        </note> Ministers to him, of his special acquaintance, whose presence much cheered him, to whom he said: I am here, you see, the Lords prisoner, cast upon the bed of my sickness, and in great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet waiting upon the mercies of my God, for a comfortable release in due season: And being asked by them, whether his consolations did not abound in the midst of all his afflictions; he answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Yes, I thank God they do, and do far exceed them: Yea, and that which is more remarkable, the Lord of his mercy hath given me such strong <note place="margin">His freedom from tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Evidence of his favor and love in Christ, that I am not troubled in mind or conscience with any doubts or fears, or any other Satanical molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or tentations, but rest and waite in patience for the accomplishing his mercies upon me, according to his good pleasure towards me: Then he desired them to pray with him, &amp; raising up himself in his bed, with his heart and hands lift up to God in the heavens, he did, as it were, reach after the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were made for him, often with a cheerful consent, saying, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi> He continued in <note place="margin">Patience.</note> great pain of body, but in great peace of mind,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:117874:259"/> increasing stil in consolations, and bearing his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pains with admiral patience, not shewing the least discontent in word or deed: When they took their leave of him, they mingled their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, tears, and prayers together, and so parted: He was never quiet, unless he were either medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or praying himself, or had some godly man, or some good Minister praying with him: The morning before his death, divers of his friends took their leave of him, desiring at their parting a blessing from him, which he did willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, by lifting up his hands and heart unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for them: And not long after, hearing some making motion of blacks, he said: <hi>I will have no</hi>

                        <hi>blacks, I love no proud nor pompous Funeral, neither is there any cause of mourning, but of rejoycing rather in my particular:</hi> Immediatly before his death, lifting up his hands, he said: <hi>The Lord is my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, my help, and my trust: His blessed Son Jesus Christ is my Saviour and Redeemer, Amen, Even so saith the Spirit unto my spirit: Therefore come Lord Jesus, and kiss me with the kisses of thy mouth, and imbrace me with the Arms of thy Love: Into thy hands do I commend my spirit, O come now, and take me to thine own self: O come Lord Jesus, come quickly, O come, O come, O come:</hi> And so his spirit fainting, <note place="margin">His death.</note> and speech failing, he meekly and graciously yielded up his pretious soul into the hands of God his Father, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1625. and of his Age sixty five.</p>
                     <p>Not long before his last sickness, my self being with him; amongst other diiscourse,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:117874:259"/> he told me, that when he first procured the setting up of an Exercise at <hi>Tarvin,</hi> he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding solicitous to procure all the Eminentest Ministers in those parts of the Kingdom to supply it, which coming many miles, they were divers times hindered by foul weather, flouds, or some sudden accident or other, so that at a very short warning, he was forced many times to get some honest neighbour Ministers to supply their places, and usually he, and most of the Congregaiton found more edification, and comfort by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <note place="margin">Note.</note> of those honest plain Preachers, then they did by the Sermons of such as were far more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for parts: <hi>Whereupon,</hi> said he, <hi>to me, I resolved to give over my former course, and to content my self with godly neighbouring Ministers, seeing God had shewed me, that it was not the greatness of mens parts, who were much admired every where, but the efficacy of the Spirit, which makes the Word effectuall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</hi>
